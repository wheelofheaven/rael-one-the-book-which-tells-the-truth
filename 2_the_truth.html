<p>The following day I was at the meeting place again as arranged with a notebook, a pen and the Bible. The flying machine reappeared on time, and I found myself face to face once more with the little man who invited me to enter the machine and sit in the same comfortable chair.</p>
<p>I had spoken to nobody about all this, not even to those closest to me, and he was happy to learn that I had been discreet. He suggested I take notes, and then he started to speak:</p>
<p>'A very long time ago on our distant planet, we had reached a level of technical and scientific knowledge, comparable to that which you will soon reach. Our scientists had started to create primitive, embryonic forms of life, namely living cells in test tubes. Everyone was thrilled by this.'</p>
<p>The scientists perfected their techniques and began creating bizarre little animals but the government, under pressure from public opinion, ordered the scientists to stop their experiments for fear they would create monsters, which would become dangerous to society. In fact one of these animals had broken loose and killed several people.</p>
<p>Since at that time, interplanetary and intergalactic explorations had also made progress, the scientists decided to set out for a distant planet where they could find most of the necessary conditions to pursue their experiments. They chose Earth where you live. Now I would like you to refer to the Bible where you will find traces of the truth about your past. These traces, of course, have been somewhat distorted by successive transcribers who could not conceive of such high technology and could therefore only explain what was described as being a mystical and supernatural force.</p>
<p>Only the parts of the Bible that I will translate are important. Other parts are merely poetic babblings of which I will say nothing.</p>
<p>I am sure you can appreciate that, thanks to the law, which said that the Bible had always to be re-copied without changing even the smallest detail, the deepest meaning has remained intact throughout the ages, even if the text has been larded with mystical and futile sentences.
So let us start with the first chapter of the Book of Genesis: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the beginning Elohim created the heaven and the earth.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 1: 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Elohim</em>, translated without justification in some Bibles by the word <em>God</em> means in Hebrew &quot;those who came from the sky&quot;, and furthermore the word is a plural. It means that the scientists from our world searched for a planet that was suitable to carry out their projects. They &quot;created&quot;, or in reality discovered the Earth, and realized it contained all the necessary elements for the creation of artificial life, even if its atmosphere was not quite the same as our own.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the Spirit of Elohim moved upon the face of the waters. </p>
<p><em>— Genesis 1: 2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means the scientists made reconnaissance flights, and what you might call artificial satellites were placed around the Earth to study its constitution and atmosphere. The Earth was, at that time, completely covered with water and thick mist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Elohim saw the light, that it was good.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 1: 4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To create life on Earth it was important to know whether the sun was sending harmful rays to the Earth's surface, and this question was fully researched. It turned out that the sun was heating the Earth correctly without sending out harmful rays. In other words the &quot;light was good&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the evening and the morning were the first day.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 1: 5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This research took quite some time. The &quot;day&quot; mentioned here corresponds to the period in which your sun rises under the same sign on the day of the vernal equinox, in other words, about 2,000 years on Earth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Elohim made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 1: 7.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After studying the cosmic rays above the clouds the scientists descended below the clouds but stayed above the waters. That means they were between the clouds, &quot;the waters which were above the firmament&quot;, and the ocean covering the whole planet, &quot;the waters which were under the firmament&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 1: 9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After they studied the surface of the ocean they studied the sea bed and determined that it was not very deep and fairly even everywhere.</p>
<p>So then, by means of fairly strong explosions, which acted rather like bulldozers, they raised matter from the bottom of the seas and piled it up into one place to form a continent. Originally there was on Earth only one continent, and your scientists have recently acknowledged that all the continents, which have drifted apart over many years, used to fit perfectly into one another to form one land mass.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 1: 11.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this magnificent and gigantic laboratory, they created vegetable cells from nothing other than chemicals, which then produced various types of plants. All their efforts were aimed at reproduction.</p>
<p>The few blares of grass they created had to reproduce on their own. The scientists spread out across this immense continent in small research teams. Every individual created different varieties of plants according to their inspiration and the climate. They met up at regular intervals to compare their research and their creations. The people back on their own planet followed their progress from afar with passion and amazement. The most brilliant artists came and joined the scientists in order to give some plants purely decorative and pleasing roles, either through their appearance or their perfume.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for
days, and years.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 1: 14.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By observing the stars and the sun they could measure the duration of the days, the months and the years on Earth. This helped them regulate their life on the new planet - so different from their own where days and years did not have the same duration. Research in astronomy enabled them to locate themselves precisely and to understand the Earth better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 1: 20.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next they created the first aquatic animals, from plankton to small fish, then very large fish. They also created seaweed to balance this little world, so that the small fish could feed on it and the bigger fish could eat the small fish in turn.</p>
<p>Thus a natural balance would be established, and one species would not destroy another species in order to survive. This is what you now refer to as &quot;ecology&quot;, and that was achieved successfully. The scientists and artists met often and organized competitions to determine which team had created the most beautiful or most interesting animals.</p>
<p>After the fish they created birds. This was done under pressure, it must be said, from the artists, who went out of their way to create the most stunning forms with the craziest colors. Some of them had great trouble flying because their beautiful feathers were very cumbersome.</p>
<p>The contests went even further, embracing not only physical characteristics but also the behavior of these animals, particularly the wonderful dances of their mating rituals.</p>
<p>Some other groups of scientists created frightful animals, veritable monsters, which proved right those people who had opposed the creation plans on their own planet. These were dragons, or what you call dinosaurs and brontosaurs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth, each according to its kind.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 1: 24.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After marine organisms and birds, the scientists created land animals on a planet where the vegetation had by now become magnificent. There was plenty of food for the herbivores. These were the first land animals which were created. Later they created carnivores to balance the herbivorous population. Here too, the species had to maintain equilibrium. Those scientists who did all this came from the same planet as me. I am one of those people who created life on Earth.</p>
<p>It was at that time that the most skillful among us wanted to create an artificial human being like ourselves. Each team set to work, and very soon we were able to compare our creations. But on our home planet people were outraged when they heard that we were making</p>
<p>&quot;test tube children&quot; who might come to threaten their world. They feared that these new human beings could become a danger if their mental capacities or powers turned out to be superior to those of their creators. So we had to agree to leave the new humans to live in a very primitive way without letting them know anything scientific, and we mystified our actions. It is easy to work out how many teams of creators did this - each race on Earth corresponds to a team of creators.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 1: 26.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;In our image!&quot; You can see that the resemblance is striking. That is when the trouble started for us. The team located in the country you now call Israel, which at the time was not far from Greece and Turkey on the original continent, was composed of brilliant creators who were perhaps the most talented team of all.</p>
<p>Their animals were the most beautiful and their plants had the sweetest perfumes. This was what you call &quot;paradise on Earth&quot;. The human beings they created there were the most intelligent. So steps had to be taken to ensure that they did not surpass their creators. The created, therefore, had to be kept in ignorance of the great scientific secrets while being educated for the purpose of measuring their intelligence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die...</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 2: 16-17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means you - the created - can learn all you want, read all of the books that we have here at your disposal, but never touch the scientific books, otherwise you will die.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He brought them to the man to see what he would name them.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 2: 19.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Human beings had to have a thorough understanding of the plants and animals living around them, their way of life, and the way to get food from them. The creators taught them the names and the powers of everything that existed around them since botany and zoology were not considered dangerous for them. Imagine the joy of this team of scientists, having two children, a male and a female running around, eagerly learning what was being taught to them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The serpent... said unto the woman... of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden... ye shall not surely die, for Elohim doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be like Elohim. </p>
<p><em>— Genesis 3: 1-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some scientists in this team felt a deep love for their little human beings, their &quot;creatures&quot;, and they wanted to give them a complete education in order to make them scientists like themselves. So they told these young people who were almost adults that they could pursue their scientific studies and in so doing they would become as knowledgeable as their creators.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 3: 7.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new human beings then understood that they could also become creators in their turn, and they became angry at their &quot;parents&quot; for having kept them away from scientific books, considering them to be like dangerous laboratory animals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Yahweh Elohim said unto the serpent, 'Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed... upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.'</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 3: 14.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;serpent&quot; was this small group of creators who had wished to tell the truth to Adam and Eve, and as a result they were condemned by the government of their own planet to live in exile on Earth, while all the other scientists had to put a stop to their experiments and leave the Earth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unto Adam also and to his wife did Yahweh Elohim make coats of skins, and clothed them.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 3: 21.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators gave their creations the basic means of survival, enough to manage without needing any further contact with them.</p>
<p>The Bible has preserved a sentence, which is close to the original document:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil2: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever. </p>
<p><em>— Genesis 3: 22.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Human life is very short, but there is a scientific way to prolong it. Human scientists who study all their lives can only begin to amass sufficient knowledge to start making interesting discoveries when they get old, which is the reason why human progress is so slow. If humans could live ten times longer, scientific knowledge would take a gigantic leap forward.</p>
<p>If when they were first created these new beings could have lived much longer, they would have quite rapidly become our equals because their mental faculties are slightly superior to our own. They are unaware of their full potential. This applies especially to the people of Israel who, as I mentioned earlier, had been selected in a contest as the most successful type of humanoid on Earth due to their intelligence and genius. This explains why they have always</p>
<p>considered themselves to be the &quot;chosen people&quot;. In truth they were the people chosen by the teams of scientists who gathered together to judge their creations. You can see for yourself the number of geniuses born out of that race.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 3: 24.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soldiers with atomic disintegration weapons were placed at the entrance to the creators' residence to prevent human beings from stealing more scientific knowledge. '</p>
<h2 id="the-flood"><a class="header" href="#the-flood">The Flood</a></h2>
<p>'Let us move on to the fourth chapter of Genesis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Yahweh. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 4: 3-4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators in exile who were left under military surveillance, urged the human beings to bring them food in order to show their own superiors that the newly created people were good, and that they would never turn against their creators. Thus they managed to obtain permission for the leaders of these first human beings to benefit from the &quot;tree of life&quot;, and this explains how they lived so long: Adam lived for 930 years, Seth for 912 years and Enos for 905 years, and so on as is stated in <em>Genesis,</em> Chapter 5, Verses 1-11.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of Elohim saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. </p>
<p><em>— Genesis 6: 1-2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators living in exile took the most beautiful daughters of humanity and made them their wives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. </p>
<p><em>— Genesis 6: 3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Longevity is not hereditary and much to the relief of the authorities on the distant planet, the children of the new human beings did not automatically benefit from the &quot;tree of life&quot;. Thus the secret of life was lost, and mankind's progress was slowed down.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the sons of Elohim came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 6: 4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There you have proof that the creators could have intercourse with the daughters of humanity whom they had created in their own image, and in so doing produced exceptional children. These actions seemed very dangerous to people on the distant planet. The scientific progress on Earth was fantastic, and they decided to destroy what had been created.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Elohim saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 6: 5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;evil&quot; in question was the desire of human beings to become scientific and independent people equal to their creators. Being &quot;good&quot;, as far as those on the Elohim's planet were concerned meant the new human beings would remain primitive, vegetating on the Earth. Their &quot;evil&quot; was their wish to progress, perhaps enabling them one day to catch up with their creators.</p>
<p>The government then decided from their distant planet to destroy all life on Earth by sending nuclear missiles. However when the exiled creators were informed of the project they asked Noah to build a spaceship, which would orbit the Earth during the cataclysm containing a pair of each species that was to be preserved.</p>
<p>This was true figuratively speaking, but in reality -and your scientific knowledge will very soon enable you to understand this- a single living cell of each species, male and female, is all that is required to recreate a whole being. This is something like the first living cell of a fetus in the womb of its mother, which already possesses all the information needed to create a human being right down to the color of its eyes and hair. This was a colossal task, but it was completed on time.</p>
<p>When the explosion took place, life had already been preserved a few thousand kilometers above the Earth. The continent was submerged by a gigantic tidal wave, which destroyed all forms of life on its surface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ark... was lift up above the earth.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 7: 17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can clearly see, it is said that the ark was lifted &quot;above&quot; the Earth and not &quot;on&quot; the water.</p>
<p>Then it was necessary to wait until there was no more dangerous radioactive fallout:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 7: 24.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The spacecraft had three sections: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>...and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 6: 16.</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later it landed on Earth, and besides Noah, it carried a couple from each race of human beings on the Earth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Elohim remembered Noah... and Elohim made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 8: 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After monitoring the level of radioactivity and dispersing it scientifically, the creators told Noah to release the animals to see if they could survive in the atmosphere. This operation was successful, and they were able to venture out into the open air. The creators then asked the human survivors to work and multiply, and show their gratitude to their benefactors who had created them and saved them from destruction. Noah agreed to give a portion of their harvest and their cattle to the creators to ensure they survived:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Noah builded an altar unto Yahweh; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 8: 20.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators were happy to see that humans wished them well, and they promised never to try to destroy their creation again. They understood that it was only normal for them to want to progress scientifically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...for the imagination of man's heart is evil.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 8: 21.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goal of humankind is scientific progress. Each race of humanity was then returned to its original place of creation, and each animal was recreated from the cells which had been preserved aboard the ark.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 10: 32.'</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-tower-of-babel"><a class="header" href="#the-tower-of-babel">The Tower of Babel</a></h2>
<p>'But the most intelligent race, the people of Israel, was making such remarkable progress that they were soon able to undertake the conquest of space with the help of the exiled creators. The latter wanted their new human beings to go to the creators' planet to obtain their pardon, by showing that they were not only intelligent and scientific but also grateful and peaceful. So they built an enormous rocket — The Tower of Babel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 11: 6.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The people on our planet became frightened when they heard about this. They were still observing the Earth and knew that life had not been destroyed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. So Yahweh scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 11: 7-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So they came and took the Jews who had the most scientific knowledge and scattered them all over the continent among primitive tribes in countries where nobody could understand them because the language was different, and they destroyed all their scientific instruments.'</p>
<h2 id="sodom-and-gomorrah"><a class="header" href="#sodom-and-gomorrah">Sodom and Gomorrah</a></h2>
<p>'The exiled creators were pardoned and allowed to return to their original planet where they pleaded the case of their magnificent creation. As a result, everyone on the distant planet fixed their eyes on the Earth because it was inhabited by people they had themselves created.</p>
<p>But among the humans who had been dispersed on Earth, a few nursed the desire for vengeance, so they gathered in the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah and, having managed to salvage a few scientific secrets, they prepared an expedition aimed at punishing those who had tried to destroy them. Consequently, the creators sent two spies to investigate what was going on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And there came two angels to Sodom at even.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 19: 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some humans tried to kill them, but the spies managed to blind their attackers with a pocket atomic weapon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 19: 11.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They warned those who were peaceful to leave the town because they were going to destroy it with an atomic explosion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Up, get you out of this place; for Yahweh will destroy this city.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 19: 14.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the people were leaving town, they were in no particular hurry because they did not realize what an atomic explosion could mean.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 19: 17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the bomb fell on Sodom and Gomorrah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then Yahweh rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Yahweh out of heaven; And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. </p>
<p><em>— Genesis 19: 24-26.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you now know, burns caused by an atomic explosion kill those who are too near and make them look like salt statues.'</p>
<h2 id="the-sacrifice-of-abraham"><a class="header" href="#the-sacrifice-of-abraham">The Sacrifice of Abraham</a></h2>
<p>'Later, after most of their leading intellectuals had been destroyed, and they had relapsed into a semi-primitive state, the creators wished to see if the people of Israel, and particularly their leader, still had positive feelings towards them. This is related in the paragraph where Abraham wants to sacrifice his own son. The creators tested him to see if his feelings towards them were sufficiently strong. Fortunately, the experiment ended positively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest Elohim.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 22: 12.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There you have it. Assimilate it all and write down everything that I have just told you. I will tell you more tomorrow.'</p>
<p>Once again the small man took leave of me, and his spacecraft rose slowly into the air. Because the sky was clearer this time, I was able to watch more closely as it took off. It hovered motionless at a height of about 400 meters, then still without the slightest sound, the vessel turned red as if it was heating up, then as white as white-hot metal, and then finally a sort of bluish purple like an enormous spark, which was impossible to look at. Then it disappeared completely.</p>
