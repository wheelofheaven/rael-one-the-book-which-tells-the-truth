<p>The following day I again met with my visitor, and he immediately continued his story.</p>
<p>'In <em>Genesis</em>, Chapter 28, there is another description of our presence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of Elohim ascending and descending on it.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 28: 12.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of the destruction of centers of progress such as Sodom and Gomorrah and the elimination of the most intelligent individuals, human beings had lapsed back into a very primitive state and had begun, rather stupidly, to adore pieces of stone and idols, forgetting those who had really created them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Put away the foreign gods that are among you.</p>
<p><em>— Genesis 35: 2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <em>Exodus,</em> we appeared to Moses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the angel of Yahweh appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush. </p>
<p><em>— Exodus 3: 2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A rocket landed in front of him, and his description corresponds to what a Brazilian tribesman might say today if we were to land before him in a flying vessel illuminating the trees without burning them.</p>
<p>The people chosen as the most intelligent had lost their most brilliant minds and had become slaves to neighboring tribes who were more numerous since they had not undergone the same destruction. It was thus necessary to restore dignity to the people of Israel by returning their land to them.</p>
<p>The beginning of <em>Exodus</em> describes all that we had to do to help liberate the people of Israel. Once departed, we guided them to the country, which we had destined for them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night.</p>
<p><em>— Exodus 13: 21.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to slow down the march of the Egyptians who had started to pursue them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them... and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.</p>
<p><em>— Exodus 14: 19-20.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The smoke emitted behind the people of Israel made a curtain, which slowed down their pursuers. Then the crossing of the water was made possible by a repulsion beam, which cleared a passageway:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.</p>
<p><em>— Exodus 14: 21.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians.</p>
<p><em>— Exodus 14: 30.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While they were crossing the desert the chosen people began to feel hungry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.</p>
<p><em>— Exodus 16: 14.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The manna was nothing more than pulverized synthetic chemical food, which when spread on the ground, swelled with the early morning dew.</p>
<p>As for the staff which allowed Moses to draw water from the rock, as it says in <em>Exodus 17:6</em> - it was nothing but a detector of underground water pools similar to those which you use at present to find oil, for example. Once the water is located, one has only to dig.</p>
<p>Then in Chapter 20 of <em>Exodus</em> a certain number of rules are cited. Because the Israelites were so primitive, they needed laws regarding morals and especially hygiene. These were outlined in the commandments. The creators came to dictate these laws to Moses on Mount Sinai, and they arrived in a flying vessel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled... And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because Yahweh descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder. Moses spake, and Elohim answered him by a voice.</p>
<p><em>— Exodus 19: 16-19.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators were afraid of being invaded or maltreated by human beings. It was therefore essential that they be respected, even venerated, so that they would be in no danger:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The people cannot come up to mount Sinai... but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto Yahweh, lest he break forth upon them.</p>
<p><em>— Exodus 19: 23-24.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, it was written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Moses alone shall come near Yahweh: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.</p>
<p><em>— Exodus 24: 2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They saw the God of Israel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.</p>
<p><em>— Exodus 24: 10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There you have the description of the pedestal upon which one of the creators presented himself, and it was made of the same bluish alloys as the floor of the machine in which we are now sitting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the sight of the glory of Yahweh was like devouring fire on the top of the mount.</p>
<p><em>— Exodus 24: 17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here you have a description of &quot;the glory&quot; of the creators -in reality, the flying vessel- and, as you have already noticed, upon take-off it has a coloration similar to that of fire.</p>
<p>This team of creators was going to live on the Earth for some time, and they wished to eat fresh food. That is why they asked the Israelites to bring them fresh provisions regularly and also riches, which they wanted to take back to their own planet. I suppose you might call it colonization:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering. And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair. </p>
<p><em>— Exodus 25: 2-4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also decided that they would like to live more comfortably, so they asked the human beings to build them a residence according to plans they had drawn up. The plans are described in Chapter 26 of the <em>Book of Exodus</em>. In this residence they would meet the representatives of the people. It was a meeting tent where people brought food and gifts as a pledge of submission.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle and Yahwehtalked with Moses... And Yahweh spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend.</p>
<p><em>— Exodus 33: 8-11.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as today I can speak to you as you can speak to me, man to man.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.</p>
<p><em>— Exodus 33: 20.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There you have reference to the difference in atmosphere between our planets. Humans cannot see their creators unless the latter are protected by a pressurized suit, because the terrestrial atmosphere is not suitable for them. If a man came to our planet he would see the creators without a space suit, but he would die because the atmosphere is not suitable for him.</p>
<p>The entire beginning of <em>Leviticus</em> explains how the foods offered to the creators had to be brought to them for their replenishment. For example, in <em>Leviticus 21: 17</em> it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his Elohim.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is obviously to prevent sick or deformed people, who were symbols of failure and therefore unbearable to the eyes of the creators, from presenting themselves before them.</p>
<p>In the <em>Book of Numbers 11:7-8</em> there is a very precise description of the manna, which your chemists could very easily reproduce:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium... and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This manna was nothing more than a chemical food, but the creators preferred fresh fruits and vegetables:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto Yahweh, shall be thine.</p>
<p><em>— Numbers 18: 13.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, the creators taught human beings how to inject themselves to treat snakebites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.</p>
<p><em>— Numbers 21: 8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As soon as someone was bitten, he &quot;looked&quot; at the &quot;serpent of brass&quot;, that is to say, a syringe was brought to him, and he was injected with serum.</p>
<p>Finally, the journey, which led the &quot;chosen people&quot; to the Promised Land, came to an end. Following the advice of the creators, they destroyed the idols of the local primitive people and took over their territories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then ye shall... destroy all their molten images...and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.</p>
<p><em>— Numbers 33: 52-53.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;chosen people&quot; finally reached their Promised Land:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them.</p>
<p><em>— Deuteronomy 4: 37.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Book of Joshua,</em> Chapter 3, Verses 15-16, we read about the crossing of the Jordan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan... the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city... and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus the creators helped the &quot;chosen people&quot; cross without getting their feet wet, just as they had done in their escape from the Egyptians by using the same water repulsion ray.'</p>
<h2 id="the-trumpets-of-jericho"><a class="header" href="#the-trumpets-of-jericho">The Trumpets of Jericho</a></h2>
<p>'At the end of Chapter 5 in the <em>Book of Joshua</em>, there is a meeting between a military creator and the chosen people regarding the resistance of the city of Jericho.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But as captain of the host5 of Yahweh am I now come.</p>
<p><em>— Joshua 5: 14.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A military consultant was sent to the Jewish people to assist them in the siege of Jericho. It is easy to understand how the walls were knocked down. You know that the very high voice of a singer can crack a crystal glass. By using highly amplified ultrasonic waves, one can knock down any concrete wall. This is what was done using a very complicated instrument, which the Bible calls a &quot;trumpet&quot;: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet... and the wall of the city shall fall down flat. </p>
<p><em>— Joshua 6: 5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a given moment, the ultrasounds were emitted in a synchronized way, and the walls fell down. A little later, some real bombing took place:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yahweh cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.</p>
<p><em>— Joshua 10: 11.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This full scale bombing, as indicated, killed more people than the swords of the Israelites. One of the most distorted passages is in <em>Joshua,</em> Chapter 10, Verse 13, where it is stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This simply means that it was a flash war, which lasted only one day — in fact, it is stated later that the war occupied &quot;about a whole day&quot;. It was so short, when you consider the extent of the land conquered, that people thought the sun had stood still.</p>
<p>In the <em>Book of Judges</em>, Chapter 6, Verse 21, one of the creators is again in contact with a man called Gideon who delivers food to him: Then the angel of Yahweh put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of Yahweh departed out of his sight.</p>
<p>The creators were unable to eat in the open air because of their pressurized suits, but if necessary, using a scientific technique, they could feed themselves by extracting the essentials from these offerings using a flexible tube or cane. The process radiates flames, which made people at the time think sacrifices to God were being made.</p>
<p>In Chapter 7 of the <em>Book of Judges,</em> 300 men with &quot;trumpets&quot; surrounded the enemy camp, and using highly amplified ultrasonic instruments, they blew them simultaneously in order to drive all the people in the camp mad. You know now that certain high pitched sounds carried to extremes can drive anyone mad.</p>
<p>Indeed the people who had been surrounded went mad; the soldiers killed each other and ran away.'</p>
<h2 id="samson-the-telepathist"><a class="header" href="#samson-the-telepathist">Samson the Telepathist</a></h2>
<p>'In <em>Judges,</em> Chapter 13, there is yet another example of mating taking place between the creators and human women:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the angel of Yahweh appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son. </p>
<p><em>— Judges 13: 3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was necessary that the fruit of this union be healthy so that the behavior of the child could be studied. This is why he tells her: And drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>for, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto Elohim from the womb.</p>
<p><em>— Judges 13: 4-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, it is written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the angel of Elohim came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.</p>
<p><em>— Judges 13: 9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is easy to imagine what happened during her husband's absence... It was an easy task for the scientists to cure her sterility. In this way she was made aware that she was going to give birth to an exceptional individual, and that she should take the utmost care of her baby. It was wonderful for the creators to mate with a daughter of humanity. This enabled them to have sons ruling directly on Earth, where the atmosphere was not suitable for themselves.</p>
<p>The point about not shaving off any hair is very important. The human brain is like a huge transmitter, capable of sending out a multitude of very accurate waves and thoughts. In fact, telepathy is nothing more than that.</p>
<p>But this type of transmitter requires antennae, and the hair and beard are these antennae. That is why you should not shave off any hair if you want to make use of your transmitters. You have surely noticed that many of your scientists have long hair, and often a beard. Prophets and other wise people have them too. Now you can understand why.</p>
<p>The child was born. It was Samson, whose story you know. He was able to communicate directly with &quot;God&quot; by telepathy, thanks to his natural antennae — his hair. And the creators could then help him during difficult moments and produce marvels to reinforce his authority.</p>
<p>But when Delilah cut his hair, he could no longer ask for help. Then his eyes were gouged out by his enemies, but when his hair grew again, he regained his &quot;strength&quot;. That is to say, he could once again ask for help from the creators who then demolished the temple where he was touching the columns. All of this was attributed to Samson's strength.</p>
<p>In <em>Samuel,</em> Chapter 3, we find Elijah initiating Samuel into telepathy. The creators wanted to contact Samuel, and he thinks that Elijah is speaking to him. He &quot;hears voices&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Yahweh; for thy servant heareth.</p>
<p><em>— 1 Samuel 3: 9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a little like the behavior of amateur radio operators who might say, &quot;Go ahead, I can hear you loud and clear&quot;. And the telepathic conversation begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Samuel, Samuel.' Then Samuel answered, 'Speak; for thy servant heareth.'</p>
<p><em>— 1 Samuel 3: 10-11.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the episode where David challenges Goliath there is quite an interesting sentence which ends:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...that he should defy the armies of the living Elohim?</p>
<p><em>— 1 Samuel 17: 26.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shows the reality of the presence in that epoch of a quite tangible &quot;God&quot;. Telepathy as a means of communication between the creators and human beings was only possible when the Elohim were in proximity to the Earth.</p>
<p>When they were on their distant planet, or elsewhere, they could not communicate in this way.</p>
<p>For this reason they set up a transmitter-receiver, which was transported in the &quot;Ark of God&quot; - an apparatus containing its own atomic powered cell. This is why in the <em>First Book of Samuel</em>, Chapters 5 and 6, when the Philistines stole the Ark, their idol Dagon lay face down on the ground nearby, as the result of an electrical discharge caused by their clumsy mishandling of it.</p>
<p>They also suffered radiation burns from the dangerous radioactive materials:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And smote them with emerods.</p>
<p><em>— 1 Samuel 5: 6.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even the Jews who had not taken precautions while handling the Ark were
harmed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of Elohim, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it. And the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzzah; and Elohim smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of Elohim.</p>
<p><em>— 2 Samuel 6: 6-7.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Ark almost fell over and Uzzah, trying to hold it up, touched a dangerous part of the machine and was electrocuted.</p>
<p>In the first book of <em>Kings</em> ( <em>1 Kings</em> 1:50 and <em>1 Kings</em> 2:28), we read in several places of individuals who &quot;caught hold on the horns of the altar&quot;.</p>
<p>This refers to the manipulation of the transmitter-receiver levers while trying to communicate with the creators.'</p>
<h2 id="the-first-residence-to-welcome-the-elohim"><a class="header" href="#the-first-residence-to-welcome-the-elohim">The First Residence to Welcome the Elohim</a></h2>
<p>'The great King Solomon had a sumptuous residence built in order to welcome the creators when they came to visit the Earth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yahweh said He would dwell in thick darkness. I have surely built thee an house to dwell in.</p>
<p><em>— 1 Kings 8: 12-13.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For the glory of Yahweh had filled the house of Yahweh.</p>
<p><em>— 1 Kings 8: 11.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The cloud filled the house of Yahweh.</p>
<p><em>— 1 Kings 8: 10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I will dwell among the children of Israel.</p>
<p><em>— 1 Kings 6: 13.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the creators lived in a cloud, or rather in a vessel that orbits above the clouds. Imagine trying to make primitive people understand that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There came a man of Elohim out of Judah by the word of Yahweh unto Bethel...and said...behold, the altar shall be rent. When king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of Elohim, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, 'Lay hold on him.' And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.</p>
<p><em>— 1 Kings 13: 1-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the help of an atomic disintegrator, one of the creators destroyed the altar and burned the hand of the man who did not show respect for the creators. He returns to one of the Elohim's terrestrial camps by another route to keep their whereabouts secret: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.</p>
<p><em>— 1 Kings 13: 10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <em>1 Kings,</em> Chapter 17, Verse 6, there is an example of the radio control of animals through the use of electrodes, as you yourselves are beginning to discover:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of recent discoveries, the creators decided to appear as little as possible in order not to influence the destiny of Man too much, so that they could see if they would reach the age of scientific knowledge on their own. So, the creators began to use increasingly discreet means of communicating with humans, as in the method of feeding Elijah using &quot;homing&quot; ravens.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of a gigantic experiment throughout the galaxy in which several humanities are in competition. The creators decided to appear less often, while at the same time reinforcing the authority and reputation of their ambassadors - the prophets - by using miracles. That is to say, scientific means which were then incomprehensible to the people of that era:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>See, your son lives!... Now by this I know that you are a man of God.</p>
<p><em>— 1 Kings 17: 23-24.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elijah had healed a young child who was dying. Later, he ordered two bull calves to be placed on logs at Mount Carmel, one to be consecrated to the idol Baal and the other to the creators. The one that would ignite by itself would represent the one true &quot;God&quot;.</p>
<p>Obviously, at a moment agreed upon in advance between Elijah and the creators, the Elohim's chosen log burst into flames, even though the wood was wet. This was accomplished by a powerful beam similar to a laser, emitted from a vessel hidden in the clouds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then the fire of Yahweh fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</p>
<p><em>— 1 Kings 18: 38.'</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="elijah-the-messenger"><a class="header" href="#elijah-the-messenger">Elijah the Messenger</a></h2>
<p>'The creators paid particular attention to Elijah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat. And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head.</p>
<p><em>— 1 Kings 19: 5-6.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this happened in the desert...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And, behold, Yahweh passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before Yahweh; but Yahweh was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but Yahweh was not in the earthquake: And after the earthquake a fire; but Yahweh was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.</p>
<p><em>— 1 Kings 19: 11-12.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There you have the exact description of a landing by a machine similar to one of your rockets. Then further on, a vision of the creators is described:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne, and all the host9 of heaven standing by him.</p>
<p><em>— 1 Kings 22: 19.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators once again used telepathy —this time group telepathy— so that none of the prophets could predict the truth to the King:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.</p>
<p><em>— 1 Kings 22: 22.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Second Book of Kings</em>, there is further evidence of the protection, which the creators gave to Elijah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I be a man of Elohim, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of Elohim came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</p>
<p><em>— 2 Kings 1: 12.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This operation happened again, but the third time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the angel of Yahweh said unto Elijah10, Go down with him.</p>
<p><em>— 2 Kings 1: 15.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Second Book of Kings,</em> Chapter 2, Elijah is invited onto a spacecraft, which takes off with him on board:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Yahweh would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind.</p>
<p><em>— 2 Kings 2: 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</p>
<p><em>— 2 Kings 2: 11.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a spacecraft taking off, and when the narrator speaks of horses of fire, he is referring to the fire, which was emitted from the blast pipes. If you showed certain South American or African tribes people a rocket taking off, they would be incapable of understanding this scientific phenomenon in a rational way, and would look upon it as something supernatural, mystical, and divine. When returning to their tribes, they would speak of chariots of fire and horses of fire.</p>
<p>Further on in the <em>Second Book of Kings,</em> Chapter 4, Verses 32-7</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elisha, like his father, performs a resurrection. He heals and brings back to life a child who was dead. This happens quite frequently nowadays when mouth to mouth resuscitation and heart massage revive a person whose cardiac muscle has ceased to function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Elisha proceeds to multiply the bread.'</p>
<h2 id="the-multiplication-of-bread"><a class="header" href="#the-multiplication-of-bread">The Multiplication of Bread</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>'A man... brought the man of Elohim bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley... And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men?... He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith Yahweh, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof. So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of Yahweh.</p>
<p><em>— 2 Kings 4: 42-44.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators had brought synthetic dehydrated food with them, which when added to water, increased to five times its original volume. So with twenty small loaves of bread there was enough food for a hundred people.</p>
<p>You are already familiar with the little vitamin pills, which nourished your first astronauts. They take up very little space but contain all the necessary nutritional elements. One pill is enough to feed one person. A quantity equivalent in volume to one small loaf of bread is enough to feed five people. Therefore twenty loaves are sufficient to feed one hundred people.</p>
<p>But the people of Israel had begun adoring metal idols; they had also become cannibals and were completely immoral, much to the disgust of their creators:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So was Israel carried away out of their own land.</p>
<p><em>— 2 Kings 17: 23.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was the beginning of the dispersion of the Israelites whose civilization, instead of making progress, was constantly regressing, in contrast to their neighbors, who took advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>In the <em>Book of Isaiah</em> you again find:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also Yahweh sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up... Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.</p>
<p><em>— Isaiah 6: 1-2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is a description of the creators dressed in their one piece space suits fitted with six small jet engines, two on their backs, two on their hands, and two at their feet, these ones for steering purposes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: Yahweh of hosts mustereth the host of the battle. They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even Yahweh, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.</p>
<p><em>— Isaiah 13: 4-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole truth is encapsulated in that quote, it is just a matter of reading between the lines in order to understand. <em>They come from a far country, from the end of heaven</em>. That could not be clearer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of Elohim.</p>
<p><em>— Isaiah 14: 13.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the human scientists who had accumulated sufficient knowledge to undertake a trip to the creators' planet but were destroyed at Sodom and Gomorrah. The army of the heavens is described here at that time when they arrived with the weapons of wrath to destroy the whole country. It was those human scientists of Sodom and Gomorrah who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most high.</p>
<p><em>— Isaiah 14: 14.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the destruction prevented humans from equaling their creators, &quot;the most high&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That made the world as a wilderness.</p>
<p><em>— Isaiah 14: 17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nuclear explosion is described further on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beer-elim. For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood...</p>
<p><em>— Isaiah 15: 8-9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few were saved because they sheltered in bunkers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.</p>
<p><em>— Isaiah 26: 20.</em>'</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-flying-saucers-of-ezekiel"><a class="header" href="#the-flying-saucers-of-ezekiel">The Flying Saucers of Ezekiel</a></h2>
<p>'It is in the <em>Book of Ezekiel</em>, that we find the most interesting description of one of our flying machines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with flashing lightning, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst of it as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire. Out of the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man. Everyone had four faces, and everyone of them had four wings. Their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled like burnished brass. They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings [thus]: their wings were joined one to another; they didn't turn when they went; they went everyone straight forward.</p>
<p>As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle. Their faces and their wings were separate above; two [wings] of everyone were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies. They went everyone straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went; they didn't turn when they went. As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches: [the fire] went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</p>
<p>Now as I saw the living creatures, behold, one wheel on the eretz beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces of it. The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a bareket: and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel. When they went, they went in their four directions: they didn't turn when they went. As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about. When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the eretz, the wheels were lifted up. Wherever the spirit was to go, they went; there was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the eretz, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</p>
<p>Over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse, like the awesome crystal to look on, stretched forth over their heads above. Under the expanse were their wings straight, the one toward the other: everyone had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies. When they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of Shaddai, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings. There was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings. Above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sappir stone; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above. </p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel 1: 4-26.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There you have a description, which could not be more precise, of the creators who had come out of their flying machines. The &quot;stormy wind&quot; is the trace of smoke or vapor trail that present-day planes leave behind them at high altitudes. Then the machine appeared with its blinking light, the &quot;flashing lightning&quot; and &quot;glowing metal&quot;. Later, four creators appear wearing antigravity suits with small directional jet engines attached. These are described as the &quot;wings&quot; on their metal suits and &quot;their feet... sparkled like burnished brass&quot;. You have surely noticed how shiny the suits of your astronauts are.</p>
<p>As for the &quot;flying saucers&quot; or &quot;wheels&quot;, their appearance and their operation were not at all badly described considering it is a primitive person who is speaking. &quot;as it were a wheel within a wheel...they didn't turn when they went&quot;.</p>
<p>In the center of the flying saucer, very similar to the one in which we are now sitting, was the habitable section - the rim. &quot;they four had their rims full of eyes round about&quot;. In the same way that our clothing has evolved and we no longer wear those cumbersome space suits, our vessels then had portholes -the &quot;eyes&quot; around the rims- because we had not then discovered how to see through metallic walls by modifying their atomic structure at will.</p>
<p>The flying saucers stayed near the creators ready to help them if the need arose, since they were loading supplies and carrying out routine maintenance on the large intergalactic vessel above them. Other creators inside the vessels were directing them. &quot;...for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels&quot;. This is quite clear.</p>
<p>The suit described with its four portholes was similar to your first diving suits. &quot;Everyone had four faces... they didn't turn when they went&quot;.</p>
<p>The smaller saucers were something like your own LEMs - lunar excursion modules - small, short range vehicles used for exploratory missions. Above them the larger interplanetary vessel waited.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sappir stone; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above.</p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel 1: 26.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The latter individual on the large vessel was supervising and coordinating the work of the creators. Frightened by all this, Ezekiel fell flat on his face before these things, which were so mysterious that they had to have come from no one other than &quot;God&quot;. But one of the creators said to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you... hear what I tell you... and eat that which I give you.</p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel 2: 1</em> and <em>7-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an image, like the eating from the tree of science of good and evil. It was intellectual food that he was given. In this case, it was a book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a hand stretched out to me; and behold, a scroll of a book was in it... there was writing on the inside and on the outside.</p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel 2: 9-10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was writing on both sides, a very surprising thing at that time when usually only one side of parchment was written on.</p>
<p>Then the scroll is &quot;eaten&quot;. This means that Ezekiel absorbed its meaning. What he learned is what you are learning now about humanity's origins. It was so exciting and comforting that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel 3: 3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Ezekiel is transported in the creators' vessel to the place where he was to spread the news:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing.</p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel 3: 12.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further on, the prophet is transported once again in a flying machine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of Elohim to Jerusalem. </p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel 8: 3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ezekiel noticed afterwards that beneath their &quot;wings&quot; the cherubims had hands like humans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings.</p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel 10: 8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside them...</p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel 10: 19.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me...</p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel 11: 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And the glory of Yahweh went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city. Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of Elohim into Chaldea...</p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel 11: 23-24.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There you have some of the many journeys of Ezekiel in one of the creators' flying machines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hand of Yahweh was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of Yahweh, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones.</p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel 37: 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here a miracle is about to happen. The creators go on to resurrect human beings whose only remains are their bones.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, each particle of a living being contains all the information to reconstruct it completely. All you have to do is place one of these particles, for example from bone remains, in a machine, which provides all the living matter required to reconstruct that
original being.</p>
<p>The machine supplies the matter, and the particle supplies all the required information, the blue-print according to which the being will be built, just as a spermatozoon contains all the information necessary to create a living being in the first place, right down to the color of the hair and eyes.</p>
<p>Son of man, can these bones live?... there was a noise, and behold a shaking... the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above... and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. <em>Ezekiel 37: 3-10.</em></p>
<p>All this is very easy to do, and you will do it some day. This is the origin of the ancient rituals in which elaborately protective sepulchers were built to bury great people, so that one day, they may be brought back to life everlasting. This is part of the secret of the &quot;tree of life&quot; — the secret of eternity.</p>
<p>In Chapter 40, Ezekiel is again carried away in a spacecraft, which takes him into the presence of someone wearing a space suit: Brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass...</p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel 40: 2-3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This &quot;city&quot; is one of the Earth bases that the creators used at that time. They were always located on very high mountains so that the creators would not be disturbed by humans. The man &quot;whose appearance was the appearance of brass&quot; is, of course, wearing a metallic suit. Similarly, due to our small stature, we were often mistaken for children or cherubs.</p>
<p>The priests in serving the creators in their terrestrial residence -the temple visited by Ezekiel- wore aseptic clothing when performing their duties, and those clothes always had to remain in the temple to avoid being contaminated by germs dangerous to the creators: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy.</p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel 42:14</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They should have written, &quot;for these garments are pure or sterile&quot;, but that was incomprehensible for primitive people who deified all that was told or shown to them at that period.</p>
<p>In <em>Ezekiel</em> Chapter 43, the big vessel, respectfully called &quot;the glory of God&quot;, approached.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone with His glory.</p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel, 43: 2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators did not want to be disturbed, so they issued a directive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.</p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel 44: 2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only a &quot;prince&quot; is allowed to come and speak with the creators: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before Yahweh.</p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel 44: 3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the prince had to pass through a chamber where he was disinfected by special rays:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.</p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel 44: 3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Levite priests were there to look after the creators:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood... and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me...</p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel 44: 15-16.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The odor of human perspiration was very unpleasant to the creators:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments... they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat.</p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel 44: 17-18.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a description also of how the Elohim's supply of fresh products continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first of all the firstfruits... ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house.</p>
<p><em>— Ezekiel 44: 30.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Chapter 3 of the <em>Book of Daniel,</em> King Nebuchadnezzar condemned three men to the stake for refusing to worship a metal god instead of the creators, whom he knew existed. But the three men were saved by one of the creators who came to their aid in the glowing fire, armed with a repellent and refrigerative ray. He protected them from the heat and the flames with this and allowed them to walk away totally unscathed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of Elohim.</p>
<p><em>— Daniel 3: 25.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further on, Daniel is cast into the lions' den, but the lions do not harm him. There again, nothing too complicated was involved, just a paralyzing beam to give enough time to get Daniel out of the den unharmed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My Elohim hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths.</p>
<p><em>— Daniel 6: 22.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the tenth chapter of <em>Daniel,</em> you will find another interesting description of a creator:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man... His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.</p>
<p><em>— Daniel 10: 5-6.'</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-last-judgement"><a class="header" href="#the-last-judgement">The Last Judgement</a></h2>
<p>'If the Hebrew people were dominated by the Persians and the Greeks, it was because of their lack of faith. Consequently, the Elohim punished the Hebrews by sending some of their &quot;angels&quot;  amongst the Persians and Greeks to help those nations to progress technologically.</p>
<p>This explains the great moments in the history of those two civilizations. The archangel Michael was the leader of the delegation, which was helping the Persians:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</p>
<p><em>— Daniel 10: 13.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Chapter 12 of <em>Daniel,</em> the resurrection is again mentioned: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.</p>
<p><em>— Daniel 12: 2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;Last Judgement&quot; will enable great individuals to live again. Those people who have acted positively for humanity and who have truly believed in their creators and followed their commandments will be welcomed with great joy by the people of the era when this will happen.</p>
<p>On the other hand, all the wicked people will feel shame before their judges and will live in eternal regret, as an example for the rest of humanity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.</p>
<p><em>— Daniel 12: 3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The geniuses will be the most highly esteemed and the most highly rewarded. Those just individuals, who allowed the geniuses to blossom, or the truth to triumph, will also be rewarded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.</p>
<p><em>— Daniel 12: 4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words will only be understood when humanity has reached a sufficient level of scientific understanding — that is to say, now. All this will happen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.</p>
<p><em>— Daniel 12: 7.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will be when the people of Israel recover their land after their long Diaspora. The state of Israel was created a few decades ago, at the same time as the explosion of humanity's scientific knowledge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.</p>
<p><em>— Daniel 12: 9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this will only be understood in this epoch. In recent years scientific progress and the beginning of space exploration by human beings have been such that everything seems possible for humanity. Nothing surprises people anymore, for they are used to seeing many wonders happening before their eyes on television. They can learn without astonishment that they really are made in the image of &quot;God&quot;, their almighty creator, and even as far as their scientific abilities are concerned. These days, miracles have become comprehensible.</p>
<p>In <em>Jonah</em>, the big fish that swallows the prophet is very interesting indeed. After Jonah was thrown into the water from a small boat: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now Yahweh had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</p>
<p><em>— Jonah 1: 17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;great fish&quot; was in reality a submarine, as you know such vessels now. But for the people of that time, it could only be a great fish, even though the gastric juices of such a fish would have digested a man quickly without any hope of his returning to the open air.  What is more, Jonah would have needed air to breathe. In the submarine, the creators were able to carry on a conversation with Jonah to learn about the political developments of those times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Yahweh spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.</p>
<p><em>— Jonah 2: 10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The submarine came close to the shore, and Jonah was back on land. In <em>Zechariah,</em> Chapter 5, there is another description of a flying machine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll... the length thereof is twenty cubits (9 meters) and the breadth thereof ten cubits (4.5 meters).</p>
<p><em>— Zechariah 5: 1-2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A little further on, women amongst the creators appear for the first time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork...</p>
<p><em>— Zechariah 5: 9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These two female companions were accompanying the creators and both were equipped with autonomous flying suits when they appeared before Zechariah.</p>
<p>In <em>Psalms</em> 8, Verse 5, it is said of human beings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Human beings are virtually as strong intellectually as their creators. Those who copied out the texts did not dare write &quot;equal&quot; to the Elohim as it had been originally dictated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it.</p>
<p><em>— Psalms 19: 6.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators came from a planet very far away from the Earth's orbit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun.</p>
<p><em>— Psalms 19: 4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is another allusion to the mass of Earth, which was created to form the original continent when the oceans covered the Earth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yahweh looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men. From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.</p>
<p><em>— Psalms 33: 13-14.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators watch humanity's behavior as they always have done from their flying vessels.'</p>
<h2 id="satan"><a class="header" href="#satan">Satan</a></h2>
<p>'In the <em>Book of Job</em>, Chapter 1, you have the explanation of Satan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now there was a day when the sons of Elohim came to present themselves before Yahweh, and Satan came also among them.</p>
<p><em>— Job 1: 6.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elohim in Hebrew literally means &quot;those who came from the sky&quot;. The &quot;sons of Elohim&quot;, in other words, the creators who watch human beings, report regularly to their planet of origin, indicating for the most part that human beings venerate and love the Elohim. But one of these Elohim, called Satan, was part of a group, which had always condemned the creation of other intelligent beings on a planet as close as the Earth, seeing them as a possible threat. That is why, on seeing Job's devotion, which was one of the best examples of human
beings loving their creators, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doth Job fear Elohim for nought?... But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. And Yahweh said unto Satan, 'Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand.'</p>
<p><em>— Job 1: 9-12.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hearing Satan's assertion that had Job not been rich, he would not have loved his creators, the government gave full power to Satan to ruin Job. It would then be seen if he still venerated his creators, and that is why killing him was forbidden.</p>
<p>On seeing Job's dedication to respecting his creators, even when he was ruined, the government triumphed over the opposition, Satan. But Satan retorted that though Job had lost many things, he was still in good health. So the government gave Satan <em>carte blanche</em> so long as he did not kill Job:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.</p>
<p><em>— Job 2: 6.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, in the <em>Book of Job</em>, a small sentence in Chapter 37 is very interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Him, have you spread out the skies, Strong as a cast metal mirror?</p>
<p><em>— Job 37: 18</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, are human beings capable of making a &quot;cast metal mirror&quot; — in reality flying metallic vessels? People of that time thought it was possible for no one but God. And yet today it can be done.</p>
<p>Finally, in view of Job's humility, the creators healed him and gave him back his wealth, his children and his health.'</p>
<h2 id="humans-could-not-understand"><a class="header" href="#humans-could-not-understand">Humans Could Not Understand</a></h2>
<p>'In the <em>Book of Tobit</em> in the Apocryhpha, one of the creators' robots named Raphael also came to test humanity's reaction towards its creators.</p>
<p>Once he had accomplished his mission, he left, after proving who he was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All these days I did appear unto you; but I did neither eat nor drink... for I go up to him that sent me; but write all things which are done in a book.</p>
<p><em>— Tobit 12: 19-20.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of this is easy to see in the writings. But once again you must try to understand.</p>
<p>As for wisdom, what she is, and how she came up, I will tell you, and will not hide mysteries from you: but will seek her out from the beginning of her nativity, and bring the knowledge of her into light, and will not pass over the truth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>— Wisdom of Solomon 6: 22.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the time comes, &quot;wisdom&quot;, the science, which allowed all this to happen, will be known by Man. The biblical writings will be proof of all this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For by the greatness and beauty of the creatures proportionably the maker of them is seen.</p>
<p><em>— Wisdom of Solomon 13: 5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it is simple to see the truth, recognizing the creators by observing their creations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And could not out of the good things that are seen know him that is.</p>
<p><em>— Wisdom of Solomon 13: 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To avoid being disturbed by humans, the creators built their bases on high mountains, where we now find traces of great civilizations (in the Himalayas and Peru, for example), as well as at the bottom of the sea. Gradually the mountain stations were abandoned in favor of submarine bases less accessible to humans. The creators who had been banished at the outset had hidden themselves in the oceans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In that day Yahweh with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.</p>
<p><em>— Isaiah 27: 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At that time the government of their planet wanted to destroy those who had created the humans.</p>
<p>It was not easy to see clearly among all those wonders, so of course, the creators were deified and made into something abstract because human beings were unable to understand scientific facts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.</p>
<p><em>— Isaiah 29: 12.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a long time, humanity has held the truth in its hands but could not understand until it was sufficiently evolved scientifically to decode it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every man is brutish in his knowledge...</p>
<p><em>— Jeremiah 10: 14.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Science enabled the creators to create and will enable human beings to do the same.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was... When he prepared the heavens, I was there... When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment... Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.</p>
<p><em>— Proverbs 8: 22-23, 27, 29 -31.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intelligence and science, these are the two virtues that enabled the creators to create the landmass - the single continent - and the living beings they placed upon it. And now this intelligence and this spirit leads the human brain to repeat the acts of their creators.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of time it has been so: people create other people like themselves on other planets. The cycle continues. Some die, others take over. We are your creators, and you will create other humanities:</p>
<p>That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been. <em>Ecclesiastes 3: 15.</em></p>
<p>The animals were also created and will be recreated. Just like human beings, no more, no less. The species that disappear will live again when you know how to recreate them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.</p>
<p><em>— Ecclesiastes 3: 19.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We, the creators, will only show ourselves officially if humanity is grateful to us for having created them. We fear that human beings might hold a grudge against us, which we cannot accept.</p>
<p>We would like to begin making open contact with you and give you the benefit of our considerable advance in scientific knowledge — so long as we could be sure that you would not turn against us, and that you would love us as your parents.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker!... Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands? Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou?</p>
<p><em>— Isaiah 45: 9-10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fear of not being loved by human beings has led your creators to allow you to progress scientifically by yourselves, with almost no help.</p>
<p>The emblem you see engraved on this machine and on my suit represents the truth. It is also the emblem of the Jewish people, the Star of David, which means: &quot;That which is above is like that which is below&quot;, and in its center is the swastika, which means that everything is cyclic, the top becoming the bottom, and the bottom in turn becoming the top. The origins and destiny of the creators and human beings are similar and linked.</p>
<p>Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth? <em>Isaiah 40: 21.</em></p>
<p>The traces of the creators' bases on high mountains is mentioned in the <em>Book of Amos:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He that... treadeth upon the high places of the earth.</p>
<p><em>— Amos 4: 13.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators had seven bases in all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those seven; they are the eyes of Yahweh, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</p>
<p><em>— Zechariah 4: 10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the origin of the seven-branched candlestick, the meaning of which has been lost. In the beginning at the creators' headquarters, there was a switchboard with seven lighted switches enabling them to stay in contact with the other bases and with the interplanetary vessel orbiting the Earth.</p>
<p>In <em>Psalms,</em> 139:4-6, there is an allusion to telepathy: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Yahweh, thou knowest it altogether. Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>At that time telepathy was unimaginable, hence &quot;such knowledge is too wonderful for me&quot;. Astronomy and interplanetary journeys were also unthinkable at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names. Great is our Yahweh, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.</p>
<p><em>— Psalms 147: 4-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Human beings were also unable to understand telecommunication:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly.</p>
<p><em>— Psalms 147: 15.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We now reach a decisive turning point in the creators' work. They decided at that period to let humanity progress scientifically without ever intervening directly. They understood that they themselves had been created in the same way, and that by creating similar beings to themselves, they were allowing the cycle to continue.</p>
<p>But first, in order for the truth to be spread throughout the world, they decided to send a Messiah who would be able to communicate worldwide what the people of Israel were then the only ones to know.</p>
<p>This was in preparation for the day when the original mystery would be explained in the light of scientific progress - that is to say, the revelation. So they announced him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting... And he shall stand and feed in the strength of Yahweh... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth. And this man shall be the peace.</p>
<p><em>— Micah 5: 2-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee...lowly, and riding upon an ass... and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea.</p>
<p><em>— Zechariah 9: 9-10.</em> '</p>
</blockquote>
