<p>Ever since I was nine years old I have had but one passion â€” motor racing. I founded a specialist motor sport magazine in 1970, simply to be able to live in the environment of a sport where man is constantly trying to surpass himself while striving to surpass others.</p>
<p>Since my early childhood I had dreamed of one day being a racing-car driver, following in the footsteps of someone as famous as Fangio.</p>
<p>Thanks to contacts made through the magazine I founded, I was given the opportunity to race and about ten trophies now adorn my apartment as a result of those races.</p>
<p>On the 13th of December 1973, however, I went to a volcano overlooking Clermont-Ferrand in central southern France. I went more to get a breath of fresh air than to take a drive in my car. My legs were itching after a full year following the races from circuit to circuit, almost always living on four wheels, so to speak.</p>
<p>The air was cool at the time, and the sky rather gray with a background mist. I walked and jogged a little and left the path where my car was parked, aiming to reach the center of the crater called Puy-de-Lassolas where I often went for picnics with my family in the summer.</p>
<p>What a superb and breathtaking place it was! To think that thousands of years ago, right where my feet were standing, lava had spurted out at incredibly high temperatures. Decorative volcanic 'bombs' can still be found among the debris. The stunted vegetation resembled that of Province in France but without sunshine.</p>
<p>I was just about to leave and looked for the last time towards the top of the circular mountain, which was formed by an accumulation of volcanic slag. It reminded me how many times I had slid down those steep slopes, as if I was on skis. Suddenly in the fog, I saw a red light flashing; then a sort of helicopter was descending towards me. A helicopter, however, makes a noise but at that moment, I could hear
absolutely nothing, not even the slightest whistle. A balloon maybe?</p>
<p>Site of Rael's first encounter: Puy de Lassolas, near Clermont-Ferrand, December 13th, 1973.</p>
<p>By now, the object was about twenty meters above the ground, and I could see it had a somewhat flattened shape. It was a flying saucer.</p>
<p>I had always believed in their existence, but I had never dreamed I would actually see one. It measured some seven meters in diameter, about 2.5 meters in height, was flat underneath and cone-shaped. On its underside, a very bright red light flashed, while at the top an intermittent white light reminded me of a camera flash cube. This white light was so intense, that I could not look at it without blinking.</p>
<p>The object continued to descend, without the slightest noise until it stopped and hovered motionless about two meters above the ground. I was petrified and remained absolutely still. I was not afraid, but rather filled with joy to be living through such a great moment.</p>
<p>I bitterly regretted not having brought my camera with me.</p>
<p>Then the incredible happened. A trap door opened beneath the machine and a kind of stairway unfolded to the ground. I realized that some living being was about to appear, and I wondered what it was going to look like.</p>
<p>First two feet appeared then two legs, which reassured me a little, since apparently I was about to meet a man. In the event, what at first I took to be a child came down the stairway and walked straight towards me.</p>
<p>I could see then this was certainly no child even though the figure was only about four feet (1.2 meters) tall. His eyes were slightly almond shaped, his hair was black and long, and he had a small black beard. I still had not moved, and he stopped about ten meters away from me.</p>
<p>He wore some sort of green one-piece suit, which covered his entire body, and although his head seemed to be exposed, I could see around it a strange sort of halo. It was not really a halo but the air about his face shone slightly and shimmered. It looked like an invisible shield, like a bubble, so fine that you could barely see it. His skin was white with a slightly greenish tinge, a bit like someone with liver trouble.</p>
<p>He smiled faintly, and I thought it best to return his smile. I felt rather ill at ease, so I smiled and bowed my head slightly in greeting.</p>
<p>He answered with the same gesture. Thinking that I had to find out if he could hear me, I asked: </p>
<p>'<em>Where do you come from?</em>'</p>
<p>He answered in a strong, articulate voice that was slightly nasal:</p>
<p>'From very far away.'</p>
<p>'<em>Do you speak French?</em>' I enquired.</p>
<p>'I speak all the languages of the Earth.'</p>
<p>'<em>Do you come from another planet?</em>'</p>
<p>'Yes,' he replied.</p>
<p>As he spoke, he moved closer and stopped about two meters from me.</p>
<p>'<em>Is this the first time you have visited the Earth?</em>'</p>
<p>'Oh no!'</p>
<p>'<em>Have you been here often?</em>'</p>
<p>'Very often â€” to say the least.'</p>
<p>'<em>Why did you come here?</em>'</p>
<p>'Today, to talk to you.'</p>
<p>'<em>To me?</em>'</p>
<p>'Yes, to you, Claude Vorilhon, editor of a small motor sport magazine,
married and father of two children.'</p>
<p>'<em>How do you know all that?</em>'</p>
<p>'We have been watching you for a long time.'</p>
<p>'<em>Why me?</em>'</p>
<p>'This is precisely what I want to tell you. Why did you come here on
this cold winter morning?'</p>
<p>'<em>I don't know... I felt like walking in the fresh air...</em>'</p>
<p>'Do you come here often?'</p>
<p>'<em>In the summer yes, but almost never in this season.</em>'</p>
<p>'So why did you come today? Had you planned this walk for a long time?'</p>
<p>'<em>No. I don't really know. When I woke up this morning I suddenly had an urge to come here.</em>'</p>
<p>'You came because I wanted to see you. Do you believe in telepathy?'</p>
<p>'<em>Yes, of course, it's something I've always been interested in â€” as well as the subject of &quot;flying saucers&quot;. But I never thought I'd see one myself.</em>'</p>
<p>'Well, I used telepathy to get you to come here because I have many things to tell you. Have you read the Bible?'</p>
<p>'<em>Yes, but why do you ask?</em>'</p>
<p>'Have you been reading it for a long time?'</p>
<p>'<em>No, as a matter of fact, I bought it only a few days ago.</em>'</p>
<p>'Why?'</p>
<p>'<em>I really don't know. Suddenly I had an urge to read it...</em>'</p>
<p>'Again I used telepathy to make you decide to buy it. I have chosen you for a very difficult mission, and I have many things to tell you. So come into my craft where we can talk more comfortably.'</p>
<p>I followed him, climbing up the small staircase beneath the machine, which, on closer inspection, looked more like a flattened bell with a full and bulging underside. Inside it, two seats faced one another, and the temperature was mild even though the door was still open.</p>
<p>There was no lamp, but natural light emanated from everywhere. There were no instruments like those you find in an aircraft cockpit. The floor was made of a sparkling alloy, which was slightly bluish. The chairs were colorless and translucent, but very comfortable and made from one piece of material. I sat on the larger one that was set closer to the floor, so that the face of the little man sitting in front of me was at the same level as mine.</p>
<p>He touched a spot on the wall, and the whole machine became transparent except for its top and bottom. It was like being in the open air, but the temperature was mild. He invited me to take off my coat, which I did, and then he started to speak.</p>
<p>'You regret not having brought your camera so that you could have talked about our meeting to the whole world - with proof in your hands?'</p>
<p>'<em>Yes, of course...</em>'</p>
<p>'Listen to me carefully. You will tell human beings about this meeting, but you will tell them the truth about what they are, and about what we are. Judging from their reactions we will know if we can show ourselves freely and officially. Wait until you know everything before you start speaking publicly. Then you will be able to defend yourself properly against those people who will not believe you and you will be able to bring them incontestable proof. You will write down everything I tell you and publish the writings as a book.'</p>
<p>'<em>But why did you choose me?</em>'</p>
<p>'For many reasons. First of all, we needed someone in a country where new ideas are welcomed and where it is possible to talk about such ideas openly. Democracy was born in France, and this country has a reputation the world over for being the country of freedom.</p>
<p>Also we needed someone who is intelligent and quite open to everything. Above all we needed someone who is a free thinker without being anti-religious. Because you were born of a Jewish father and a Catholic mother, we consider you to be an ideal link between two very important peoples in the history of the world.</p>
<p>Besides, your activities do not in any way predispose you to making incredible revelations, and this will make your words all the more credible. Since you are not a scientist, you will not complicate things and will explain them simply. Not being a literary man, you won't compose elaborate sentences, which are difficult to read for a great many people. Finally, we decided to choose someone who was born after
the first atomic explosion in 1945, and you were born in 1946.</p>
<p>We have in fact been following you since your birth, and even before.</p>
<p>This is why we have chosen you. Do you have any other questions?'</p>
<p>'<em>Where do you come from?</em>'</p>
<p>'From a distant planet about which I will tell you nothing for fear that men of the Earth might be unwise enough to disturb our peace.'</p>
<p>'<em>Is your planet very far away?</em>'</p>
<p>'Very far. When I tell you the distance you will understand that it is impossible to reach it with your present level of scientific and technical knowledge.'</p>
<p>'<em>What are you called?</em>'</p>
<p>'We are people like you, and we live on a planet similar to Earth.'</p>
<p>'<em>How long does it take you to come here?</em>'</p>
<p>'As long as it takes to think about it.'</p>
<p>'<em>Why do you come to Earth?</em>'</p>
<p>'To monitor and watch over the development of humanity. Human beings on Earth are the future, we are the past.'</p>
<p>'<em>Are there many people on your planet?</em>'</p>
<p>'There are more people than on yours.'</p>
<p>'<em>I would like to visit your planet. Can I?</em>'</p>
<p>'No. First of all you couldn't live there because the atmosphere is different from yours, and you have not been trained for such a journey.'</p>
<p>'<em>But why meet here?</em>'</p>
<p>'Because the crater of a volcano is an ideal place, away from irksome people. I shall leave you now. Come back tomorrow at the same time with the Bible and something to take notes with. Do not bring any metallic object and speak to no one of our conversation, otherwise we will never meet again.'</p>
<p>He handed me my coat, let me climb down the ladder and waved his hand. The ladder folded up and the door closed without a sound.</p>
<p>Still without making the slightest murmur or any whistling sound, the craft rose gently to a height of about 400 meters, then disappeared into the mist.</p>

<p>The following day I was at the meeting place again as arranged with a notebook, a pen and the Bible. The flying machine reappeared on time, and I found myself face to face once more with the little man who invited me to enter the machine and sit in the same comfortable chair.</p>
<p>I had spoken to nobody about all this, not even to those closest to me, and he was happy to learn that I had been discreet. He suggested I take notes, and then he started to speak:</p>
<p>'A very long time ago on our distant planet, we had reached a level of technical and scientific knowledge, comparable to that which you will soon reach. Our scientists had started to create primitive, embryonic forms of life, namely living cells in test tubes. Everyone was thrilled by this.'</p>
<p>The scientists perfected their techniques and began creating bizarre little animals but the government, under pressure from public opinion, ordered the scientists to stop their experiments for fear they would create monsters, which would become dangerous to society. In fact one of these animals had broken loose and killed several people.</p>
<p>Since at that time, interplanetary and intergalactic explorations had also made progress, the scientists decided to set out for a distant planet where they could find most of the necessary conditions to pursue their experiments. They chose Earth where you live. Now I would like you to refer to the Bible where you will find traces of the truth about your past. These traces, of course, have been somewhat distorted by successive transcribers who could not conceive of such high technology and could therefore only explain what was described as being a mystical and supernatural force.</p>
<p>Only the parts of the Bible that I will translate are important.</p>
<p>Other parts are merely poetic babblings of which I will say nothing.</p>
<p>I am sure you can appreciate that, thanks to the law, which said that the Bible had always to be re-copied without changing even the smallest detail, the deepest meaning has remained intact throughout the ages, even if the text has been larded with mystical and futile sentences.
So let us start with the first chapter of the Book of Genesis: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the beginning Elohim created the heaven and the earth.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 1: 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Elohim</em>, translated without justification in some Bibles by the word <em>God</em> means in Hebrew &quot;those who came from the sky&quot;, and furthermore the word is a plural. It means that the scientists from our world searched for a planet that was suitable to carry out their projects. They &quot;created&quot;, or in reality discovered the Earth, and realized it contained all the necessary elements for the creation of artificial life, even if its atmosphere was not quite the same as our own.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the Spirit of Elohim moved upon the face of the waters. </p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 1: 2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means the scientists made reconnaissance flights, and what you might call artificial satellites were placed around the Earth to study its constitution and atmosphere. The Earth was, at that time, completely covered with water and thick mist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Elohim saw the light, that it was good.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 1: 4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To create life on Earth it was important to know whether the sun was sending harmful rays to the Earth's surface, and this question was fully researched. It turned out that the sun was heating the Earth correctly without sending out harmful rays. In other words the &quot;light was good&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the evening and the morning were the first day.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 1: 5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This research took quite some time. The &quot;day&quot; mentioned here corresponds to the period in which your sun rises under the same sign on the day of the vernal equinox, in other words, about 2,000 years on Earth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Elohim made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 1: 7.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After studying the cosmic rays above the clouds the scientists descended below the clouds but stayed above the waters. That means they were between the clouds, &quot;the waters which were above the firmament&quot;, and the ocean covering the whole planet, &quot;the waters which were under the firmament&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 1: 9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After they studied the surface of the ocean they studied the sea bed and determined that it was not very deep and fairly even everywhere.</p>
<p>So then, by means of fairly strong explosions, which acted rather like bulldozers, they raised matter from the bottom of the seas and piled it up into one place to form a continent. Originally there was on Earth only one continent, and your scientists have recently acknowledged that all the continents, which have drifted apart over many years, used to fit perfectly into one another to form one land mass.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 1: 11.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this magnificent and gigantic laboratory, they created vegetable cells from nothing other than chemicals, which then produced various types of plants. All their efforts were aimed at reproduction.</p>
<p>The few blares of grass they created had to reproduce on their own. The scientists spread out across this immense continent in small research teams. Every individual created different varieties of plants according to their inspiration and the climate. They met up at regular intervals to compare their research and their creations. The people back on their own planet followed their progress from afar with passion and amazement. The most brilliant artists came and joined the scientists in order to give some plants purely decorative and pleasing roles, either through their appearance or their perfume.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for
days, and years.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 1: 14.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By observing the stars and the sun they could measure the duration of the days, the months and the years on Earth. This helped them regulate their life on the new planet - so different from their own where days and years did not have the same duration. Research in astronomy enabled them to locate themselves precisely and to understand the Earth better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 1: 20.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next they created the first aquatic animals, from plankton to small fish, then very large fish. They also created seaweed to balance this little world, so that the small fish could feed on it and the bigger fish could eat the small fish in turn.</p>
<p>Thus a natural balance would be established, and one species would not destroy another species in order to survive. This is what you now refer to as &quot;ecology&quot;, and that was achieved successfully. The scientists and artists met often and organized competitions to determine which team had created the most beautiful or most interesting animals.</p>
<p>After the fish they created birds. This was done under pressure, it must be said, from the artists, who went out of their way to create the most stunning forms with the craziest colors. Some of them had great trouble flying because their beautiful feathers were very cumbersome.</p>
<p>The contests went even further, embracing not only physical characteristics but also the behavior of these animals, particularly the wonderful dances of their mating rituals.</p>
<p>Some other groups of scientists created frightful animals, veritable monsters, which proved right those people who had opposed the creation plans on their own planet. These were dragons, or what you call dinosaurs and brontosaurs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth, each according to its kind.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 1: 24.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After marine organisms and birds, the scientists created land animals on a planet where the vegetation had by now become magnificent. There was plenty of food for the herbivores. These were the first land animals which were created. Later they created carnivores to balance the herbivorous population. Here too, the species had to maintain equilibrium. Those scientists who did all this came from the same planet as me. I am one of those people who created life on Earth.</p>
<p>It was at that time that the most skillful among us wanted to create an artificial human being like ourselves. Each team set to work, and very soon we were able to compare our creations. But on our home planet people were outraged when they heard that we were making</p>
<p>&quot;test tube children&quot; who might come to threaten their world. They feared that these new human beings could become a danger if their mental capacities or powers turned out to be superior to those of their creators. So we had to agree to leave the new humans to live in a very primitive way without letting them know anything scientific, and we mystified our actions. It is easy to work out how many teams of creators did this - each race on Earth corresponds to a team of creators.</p>
<p>Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth. <em>Genesis 1: 26.</em></p>
<p>&quot;In our image!&quot; You can see that the resemblance is striking. That is when the trouble started for us. The team located in the country you now call Israel, which at the time was not far from Greece and Turkey on the original continent, was composed of brilliant creators who were perhaps the most talented team of all.</p>
<p>Their animals were the most beautiful and their plants had the sweetest perfumes. This was what you call &quot;paradise on Earth&quot;. The human beings they created there were the most intelligent. So steps had to be taken to ensure that they did not surpass their creators. The created, therefore, had to be kept in ignorance of the great scientific secrets while being educated for the purpose of measuring their intelligence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die...</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 2: 16-17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means you - the created - can learn all you want, read all of the books that we have here at your disposal, but never touch the scientific books, otherwise you will die.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He brought them to the man to see what he would name them.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 2: 19.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Human beings had to have a thorough understanding of the plants and animals living around them, their way of life, and the way to get food from them. The creators taught them the names and the powers of everything that existed around them since botany and zoology were not considered dangerous for them. Imagine the joy of this team of scientists, having two children, a male and a female running around, eagerly learning what was being taught to them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The serpent... said unto the woman... of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden... ye shall not surely die, for Elohim doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be like Elohim. </p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 3: 1-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some scientists in this team felt a deep love for their little human beings, their &quot;creatures&quot;, and they wanted to give them a complete education in order to make them scientists like themselves. So they told these young people who were almost adults that they could pursue their scientific studies and in so doing they would become as knowledgeable as their creators.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 3: 7.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new human beings then understood that they could also become creators in their turn, and they became angry at their &quot;parents&quot; for having kept them away from scientific books, considering them to be like dangerous laboratory animals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Yahweh Elohim said unto the serpent, 'Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed... upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.'</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 3: 14.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;serpent&quot; was this small group of creators who had wished to tell the truth to Adam and Eve, and as a result they were condemned by the government of their own planet to live in exile on Earth, while all the other scientists had to put a stop to their experiments and leave the Earth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unto Adam also and to his wife did Yahweh Elohim make coats of skins, and clothed them.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 3: 21.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators gave their creations the basic means of survival, enough to manage without needing any further contact with them.</p>
<p>The Bible has preserved a sentence, which is close to the original document:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil2: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever. </p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 3: 22.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Human life is very short, but there is a scientific way to prolong it. Human scientists who study all their lives can only begin to amass sufficient knowledge to start making interesting discoveries when they get old, which is the reason why human progress is so slow. If humans could live ten times longer, scientific knowledge would take a gigantic leap forward.</p>
<p>If when they were first created these new beings could have lived much longer, they would have quite rapidly become our equals because their mental faculties are slightly superior to our own. They are unaware of their full potential. This applies especially to the people of Israel who, as I mentioned earlier, had been selected in a contest as the most successful type of humanoid on Earth due to their intelligence and genius. This explains why they have always</p>
<p>considered themselves to be the &quot;chosen people&quot;. In truth they were the people chosen by the teams of scientists who gathered together to judge their creations. You can see for yourself the number of geniuses born out of that race.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 3: 24.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soldiers with atomic disintegration weapons were placed at the entrance to the creators' residence to prevent human beings from stealing more scientific knowledge. '</p>
<h2 id="the-flood"><a class="header" href="#the-flood">The Flood</a></h2>
<p>'Let us move on to the fourth chapter of Genesis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Yahweh. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 4: 3-4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators in exile who were left under military surveillance, urged the human beings to bring them food in order to show their own superiors that the newly created people were good, and that they would never turn against their creators. Thus they managed to obtain permission for the leaders of these first human beings to benefit from the &quot;tree of life&quot;, and this explains how they lived so long: Adam lived for 930 years, Seth for 912 years and Enos for 905 years, and so on as is stated in <em>Genesis,</em> Chapter 5, Verses 1-11.</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of Elohim saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. <em>Genesis 6: 1-2.</em></p>
<p>The creators living in exile took the most beautiful daughters of humanity and made them their wives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. </p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 6: 3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Longevity is not hereditary and much to the relief of the authorities on the distant planet, the children of the new human beings did not automatically benefit from the &quot;tree of life&quot;. Thus the secret of life was lost, and mankind's progress was slowed down.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the sons of Elohim came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 6: 4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There you have proof that the creators could have intercourse with the daughters of humanity whom they had created in their own image, and in so doing produced exceptional children. These actions seemed very dangerous to people on the distant planet. The scientific progress on Earth was fantastic, and they decided to destroy what had been created.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Elohim saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 6: 5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;evil&quot; in question was the desire of human beings to become scientific and independent people equal to their creators. Being &quot;good&quot;, as far as those on the Elohim's planet were concerned meant the new human beings would remain primitive, vegetating on the Earth. Their &quot;evil&quot; was their wish to progress, perhaps enabling them one day to catch up with their creators.</p>
<p>The government then decided from their distant planet to destroy all life on Earth by sending nuclear missiles. However when the exiled creators were informed of the project they asked Noah to build a spaceship, which would orbit the Earth during the cataclysm containing a pair of each species that was to be preserved.</p>
<p>This was true figuratively speaking, but in reality -and your scientific knowledge will very soon enable you to understand this- a single living cell of each species, male and female, is all that is required to recreate a whole being. This is something like the first living cell of a fetus in the womb of its mother, which already possesses all the information needed to create a human being right down to the color of its eyes and hair. This was a colossal task, but it was completed on time.</p>
<p>When the explosion took place, life had already been preserved a few thousand kilometers above the Earth. The continent was submerged by a gigantic tidal wave, which destroyed all forms of life on its surface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ark... was lift up above the earth.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 7: 17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can clearly see, it is said that the ark was lifted &quot;above&quot; the Earth and not &quot;on&quot; the water.</p>
<p>Then it was necessary to wait until there was no more dangerous radioactive fallout:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 7: 24.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The spacecraft had three sections: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>...and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 6: 16.</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later it landed on Earth, and besides Noah, it carried a couple from each race of human beings on the Earth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Elohim remembered Noah... and Elohim made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 8: 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After monitoring the level of radioactivity and dispersing it scientifically, the creators told Noah to release the animals to see if they could survive in the atmosphere. This operation was successful, and they were able to venture out into the open air. The creators then asked the human survivors to work and multiply, and show their gratitude to their benefactors who had created them and saved them from destruction. Noah agreed to give a portion of their harvest and their cattle to the creators to ensure they survived:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Noah builded an altar unto Yahweh; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 8: 20.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators were happy to see that humans wished them well, and they promised never to try to destroy their creation again. They understood that it was only normal for them to want to progress scientifically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...for the imagination of man's heart is evil.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 8: 21.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goal of humankind is scientific progress. Each race of humanity was then returned to its original place of creation, and each animal was recreated from the cells which had been preserved aboard the ark.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 10: 32.'</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-tower-of-babel"><a class="header" href="#the-tower-of-babel">The Tower of Babel</a></h2>
<p>'But the most intelligent race, the people of Israel, was making such remarkable progress that they were soon able to undertake the conquest of space with the help of the exiled creators. The latter wanted their new human beings to go to the creators' planet to obtain their pardon, by showing that they were not only intelligent and scientific but also grateful and peaceful. So they built an enormous rocket â€” The Tower of Babel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 11: 6.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The people on our planet became frightened when they heard about this. They were still observing the Earth and knew that life had not been destroyed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. So Yahweh scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 11: 7-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So they came and took the Jews who had the most scientific knowledge and scattered them all over the continent among primitive tribes in countries where nobody could understand them because the language was different, and they destroyed all their scientific instruments.'</p>
<h2 id="sodom-and-gomorrah"><a class="header" href="#sodom-and-gomorrah">Sodom and Gomorrah</a></h2>
<p>'The exiled creators were pardoned and allowed to return to their original planet where they pleaded the case of their magnificent creation. As a result, everyone on the distant planet fixed their eyes on the Earth because it was inhabited by people they had themselves created.</p>
<p>But among the humans who had been dispersed on Earth, a few nursed the desire for vengeance, so they gathered in the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah and, having managed to salvage a few scientific secrets, they prepared an expedition aimed at punishing those who had tried to destroy them. Consequently, the creators sent two spies to investigate what was going on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And there came two angels to Sodom at even.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 19: 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some humans tried to kill them, but the spies managed to blind their attackers with a pocket atomic weapon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 19: 11.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They warned those who were peaceful to leave the town because they were going to destroy it with an atomic explosion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Up, get you out of this place; for Yahweh will destroy this city.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 19: 14.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the people were leaving town, they were in no particular hurry because they did not realize what an atomic explosion could mean.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 19: 17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the bomb fell on Sodom and Gomorrah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then Yahweh rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Yahweh out of heaven; And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. </p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 19: 24-26.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you now know, burns caused by an atomic explosion kill those who are too near and make them look like salt statues.'</p>
<h2 id="the-sacrifice-of-abraham"><a class="header" href="#the-sacrifice-of-abraham">The Sacrifice of Abraham</a></h2>
<p>'Later, after most of their leading intellectuals had been destroyed, and they had relapsed into a semi-primitive state, the creators wished to see if the people of Israel, and particularly their leader, still had positive feelings towards them. This is related in the paragraph where Abraham wants to sacrifice his own son. The creators tested him to see if his feelings towards them were sufficiently strong. Fortunately, the experiment ended positively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest Elohim.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 22: 12.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There you have it. Assimilate it all and write down everything that I have just told you. I will tell you more tomorrow.'</p>
<p>Once again the small man took leave of me, and his spacecraft rose slowly into the air. Because the sky was clearer this time, I was able to watch more closely as it took off. It hovered motionless at a height of about 400 meters, then still without the slightest sound, the vessel turned red as if it was heating up, then as white as white-hot metal, and then finally a sort of bluish purple like an enormous spark, which was impossible to look at. Then it disappeared completely.</p>

<h2 id="moses"><a class="header" href="#moses">Moses</a></h2>
<p>The following day I again met with my visitor, and he immediately continued his story.</p>
<p>'In <em>Genesis</em>, Chapter 28, there is another description of our presence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of Elohim ascending and descending on it.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 28: 12.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of the destruction of centers of progress such as Sodom and Gomorrah and the elimination of the most intelligent individuals, human beings had lapsed back into a very primitive state and had begun, rather stupidly, to adore pieces of stone and idols, forgetting those who had really created them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Put away the foreign gods that are among you.</p>
<p><em>â€” Genesis 35: 2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <em>Exodus,</em> we appeared to Moses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the angel of Yahweh appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush. </p>
<p><em>â€” Exodus 3: 2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A rocket landed in front of him, and his description corresponds to what a Brazilian tribesman might say today if we were to land before him in a flying vessel illuminating the trees without burning them.</p>
<p>The people chosen as the most intelligent had lost their most brilliant minds and had become slaves to neighboring tribes who were more numerous since they had not undergone the same destruction. It was thus necessary to restore dignity to the people of Israel by returning their land to them.</p>
<p>The beginning of <em>Exodus</em> describes all that we had to do to help liberate the people of Israel. Once departed, we guided them to the country, which we had destined for them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night.</p>
<p><em>â€” Exodus 13: 21.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to slow down the march of the Egyptians who had started to pursue them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them... and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.</p>
<p><em>â€” Exodus 14: 19-20.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The smoke emitted behind the people of Israel made a curtain, which slowed down their pursuers. Then the crossing of the water was made possible by a repulsion beam, which cleared a passageway:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.</p>
<p><em>â€” Exodus 14: 21.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians.</p>
<p><em>â€” Exodus 14: 30.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While they were crossing the desert the chosen people began to feel hungry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.</p>
<p><em>â€” Exodus 16: 14.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The manna was nothing more than pulverized synthetic chemical food, which when spread on the ground, swelled with the early morning dew.</p>
<p>As for the staff which allowed Moses to draw water from the rock, as it says in <em>Exodus 17:6</em> - it was nothing but a detector of underground water pools similar to those which you use at present to find oil, for example. Once the water is located, one has only to dig.</p>
<p>Then in Chapter 20 of <em>Exodus</em> a certain number of rules are cited. Because the Israelites were so primitive, they needed laws regarding morals and especially hygiene. These were outlined in the commandments. The creators came to dictate these laws to Moses on Mount Sinai, and they arrived in a flying vessel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled... And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because Yahweh descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder. Moses spake, and Elohim answered him by a voice.</p>
<p><em>â€” Exodus 19: 16-19.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators were afraid of being invaded or maltreated by human beings. It was therefore essential that they be respected, even venerated, so that they would be in no danger:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The people cannot come up to mount Sinai... but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto Yahweh, lest he break forth upon them.</p>
<p><em>â€” Exodus 19: 23-24.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, it was written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Moses alone shall come near Yahweh: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.</p>
<p><em>â€” Exodus 24: 2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They saw the God of Israel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.</p>
<p><em>â€” Exodus 24: 10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There you have the description of the pedestal upon which one of the creators presented himself, and it was made of the same bluish alloys as the floor of the machine in which we are now sitting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the sight of the glory of Yahweh was like devouring fire on the top of the mount.</p>
<p><em>â€” Exodus 24: 17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here you have a description of &quot;the glory&quot; of the creators -in reality, the flying vessel- and, as you have already noticed, upon take-off it has a coloration similar to that of fire.</p>
<p>This team of creators was going to live on the Earth for some time, and they wished to eat fresh food. That is why they asked the Israelites to bring them fresh provisions regularly and also riches, which they wanted to take back to their own planet. I suppose you might call it colonization:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering. And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair. </p>
<p><em>â€” Exodus 25: 2-4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also decided that they would like to live more comfortably, so they asked the human beings to build them a residence according to plans they had drawn up. The plans are described in Chapter 26 of the <em>Book of Exodus</em>. In this residence they would meet the representatives of the people. It was a meeting tent where people brought food and gifts as a pledge of submission.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle and Yahwehtalked with Moses... And Yahweh spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend.</p>
<p><em>â€” Exodus 33: 8-11.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as today I can speak to you as you can speak to me, man to man.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.</p>
<p><em>â€” Exodus 33: 20.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There you have reference to the difference in atmosphere between our planets. Humans cannot see their creators unless the latter are protected by a pressurized suit, because the terrestrial atmosphere is not suitable for them. If a man came to our planet he would see the creators without a space suit, but he would die because the atmosphere is not suitable for him.</p>
<p>The entire beginning of <em>Leviticus</em> explains how the foods offered to the creators had to be brought to them for their replenishment. For example, in <em>Leviticus 21: 17</em> it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his Elohim.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is obviously to prevent sick or deformed people, who were symbols of failure and therefore unbearable to the eyes of the creators, from presenting themselves before them.</p>
<p>In the <em>Book of Numbers 11:7-8</em> there is a very precise description of the manna, which your chemists could very easily reproduce:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium... and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This manna was nothing more than a chemical food, but the creators preferred fresh fruits and vegetables:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto Yahweh, shall be thine.</p>
<p><em>â€” Numbers 18: 13.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, the creators taught human beings how to inject themselves to treat snakebites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.</p>
<p><em>â€” Numbers 21: 8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As soon as someone was bitten, he &quot;looked&quot; at the &quot;serpent of brass&quot;, that is to say, a syringe was brought to him, and he was injected with serum.</p>
<p>Finally, the journey, which led the &quot;chosen people&quot; to the Promised Land, came to an end. Following the advice of the creators, they destroyed the idols of the local primitive people and took over their territories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then ye shall... destroy all their molten images...and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.</p>
<p><em>â€” Numbers 33: 52-53.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;chosen people&quot; finally reached their Promised Land:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them.</p>
<p><em>â€” Deuteronomy 4: 37.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Book of Joshua,</em> Chapter 3, Verses 15-16, we read about the crossing of the Jordan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan... the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city... and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus the creators helped the &quot;chosen people&quot; cross without getting their feet wet, just as they had done in their escape from the Egyptians by using the same water repulsion ray.'</p>
<h2 id="the-trumpets-of-jericho"><a class="header" href="#the-trumpets-of-jericho">The Trumpets of Jericho</a></h2>
<p>'At the end of Chapter 5 in the <em>Book of Joshua</em>, there is a meeting between a military creator and the chosen people regarding the resistance of the city of Jericho.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But as captain of the host5 of Yahweh am I now come.</p>
<p><em>â€” Joshua 5: 14.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A military consultant was sent to the Jewish people to assist them in the siege of Jericho. It is easy to understand how the walls were knocked down. You know that the very high voice of a singer can crack a crystal glass. By using highly amplified ultrasonic waves, one can knock down any concrete wall. This is what was done using a very complicated instrument, which the Bible calls a &quot;trumpet&quot;: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet... and the wall of the city shall fall down flat. </p>
<p><em>â€” Joshua 6: 5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a given moment, the ultrasounds were emitted in a synchronized way, and the walls fell down. A little later, some real bombing took place:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yahweh cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.</p>
<p><em>â€” Joshua 10: 11.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This full scale bombing, as indicated, killed more people than the swords of the Israelites. One of the most distorted passages is in <em>Joshua,</em> Chapter 10, Verse 13, where it is stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This simply means that it was a flash war, which lasted only one day â€” in fact, it is stated later that the war occupied &quot;about a whole day&quot;. It was so short, when you consider the extent of the land conquered, that people thought the sun had stood still.</p>
<p>In the <em>Book of Judges</em>, Chapter 6, Verse 21, one of the creators is again in contact with a man called Gideon who delivers food to him: Then the angel of Yahweh put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of Yahweh departed out of his sight.</p>
<p>The creators were unable to eat in the open air because of their pressurized suits, but if necessary, using a scientific technique, they could feed themselves by extracting the essentials from these offerings using a flexible tube or cane. The process radiates flames, which made people at the time think sacrifices to God were being made.</p>
<p>In Chapter 7 of the <em>Book of Judges,</em> 300 men with &quot;trumpets&quot; surrounded the enemy camp, and using highly amplified ultrasonic instruments, they blew them simultaneously in order to drive all the people in the camp mad. You know now that certain high pitched sounds carried to extremes can drive anyone mad.</p>
<p>Indeed the people who had been surrounded went mad; the soldiers killed each other and ran away.'</p>
<h2 id="samson-the-telepathist"><a class="header" href="#samson-the-telepathist">Samson the Telepathist</a></h2>
<p>'In <em>Judges,</em> Chapter 13, there is yet another example of mating taking place between the creators and human women:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the angel of Yahweh appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son. </p>
<p><em>â€” Judges 13: 3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was necessary that the fruit of this union be healthy so that the behavior of the child could be studied. This is why he tells her: And drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>for, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto Elohim from the womb.</p>
<p><em>â€” Judges 13: 4-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, it is written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the angel of Elohim came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.</p>
<p><em>â€” Judges 13: 9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is easy to imagine what happened during her husband's absence... It was an easy task for the scientists to cure her sterility. In this way she was made aware that she was going to give birth to an exceptional individual, and that she should take the utmost care of her baby. It was wonderful for the creators to mate with a daughter of humanity. This enabled them to have sons ruling directly on Earth, where the atmosphere was not suitable for themselves.</p>
<p>The point about not shaving off any hair is very important. The human brain is like a huge transmitter, capable of sending out a multitude of very accurate waves and thoughts. In fact, telepathy is nothing more than that.</p>
<p>But this type of transmitter requires antennae, and the hair and beard are these antennae. That is why you should not shave off any hair if you want to make use of your transmitters. You have surely noticed that many of your scientists have long hair, and often a beard. Prophets and other wise people have them too. Now you can understand why.</p>
<p>The child was born. It was Samson, whose story you know. He was able to communicate directly with &quot;God&quot; by telepathy, thanks to his natural antennae â€” his hair. And the creators could then help him during difficult moments and produce marvels to reinforce his authority.</p>
<p>But when Delilah cut his hair, he could no longer ask for help. Then his eyes were gouged out by his enemies, but when his hair grew again, he regained his &quot;strength&quot;. That is to say, he could once again ask for help from the creators who then demolished the temple where he was touching the columns. All of this was attributed to Samson's strength.</p>
<p>In <em>Samuel,</em> Chapter 3, we find Elijah initiating Samuel into telepathy. The creators wanted to contact Samuel, and he thinks that Elijah is speaking to him. He &quot;hears voices&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Yahweh; for thy servant heareth.</p>
<p><em>â€” 1 Samuel 3: 9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a little like the behavior of amateur radio operators who might say, &quot;Go ahead, I can hear you loud and clear&quot;. And the telepathic conversation begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Samuel, Samuel.' Then Samuel answered, 'Speak; for thy servant heareth.'</p>
<p><em>â€” 1 Samuel 3: 10-11.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the episode where David challenges Goliath there is quite an interesting sentence which ends:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...that he should defy the armies of the living Elohim?</p>
<p><em>â€” 1 Samuel 17: 26.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shows the reality of the presence in that epoch of a quite tangible &quot;God&quot;. Telepathy as a means of communication between the creators and human beings was only possible when the Elohim were in proximity to the Earth.</p>
<p>When they were on their distant planet, or elsewhere, they could not communicate in this way.</p>
<p>For this reason they set up a transmitter-receiver, which was transported in the &quot;Ark of God&quot; - an apparatus containing its own atomic powered cell. This is why in the <em>First Book of Samuel</em>, Chapters 5 and 6, when the Philistines stole the Ark, their idol Dagon lay face down on the ground nearby, as the result of an electrical discharge caused by their clumsy mishandling of it.</p>
<p>They also suffered radiation burns from the dangerous radioactive materials:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And smote them with emerods.</p>
<p><em>â€” 1 Samuel 5: 6.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even the Jews who had not taken precautions while handling the Ark were
harmed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of Elohim, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it. And the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzzah; and Elohim smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of Elohim.</p>
<p><em>â€” 2 Samuel 6: 6-7.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Ark almost fell over and Uzzah, trying to hold it up, touched a dangerous part of the machine and was electrocuted.</p>
<p>In the first book of <em>Kings</em> ( <em>1 Kings</em> 1:50 and <em>1 Kings</em> 2:28), we read in several places of individuals who &quot;caught hold on the horns of the altar&quot;.</p>
<p>This refers to the manipulation of the transmitter-receiver levers while trying to communicate with the creators.'</p>
<h2 id="the-first-residence-to-welcome-the-elohim"><a class="header" href="#the-first-residence-to-welcome-the-elohim">The First Residence to Welcome the Elohim</a></h2>
<p>'The great King Solomon had a sumptuous residence built in order to welcome the creators when they came to visit the Earth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yahweh said He would dwell in thick darkness. I have surely built thee an house to dwell in.</p>
<p><em>â€” 1 Kings 8: 12-13.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For the glory of Yahweh had filled the house of Yahweh.</p>
<p><em>â€” 1 Kings 8: 11.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The cloud filled the house of Yahweh.</p>
<p><em>â€” 1 Kings 8: 10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I will dwell among the children of Israel.</p>
<p><em>â€” 1 Kings 6: 13.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the creators lived in a cloud, or rather in a vessel that orbits above the clouds. Imagine trying to make primitive people understand that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There came a man of Elohim out of Judah by the word of Yahweh unto Bethel...and said...behold, the altar shall be rent. When king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of Elohim, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, 'Lay hold on him.' And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.</p>
<p><em>â€” 1 Kings 13: 1-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the help of an atomic disintegrator, one of the creators destroyed the altar and burned the hand of the man who did not show respect for the creators. He returns to one of the Elohim's terrestrial camps by another route to keep their whereabouts secret: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.</p>
<p><em>â€” 1 Kings 13: 10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <em>1 Kings,</em> Chapter 17, Verse 6, there is an example of the radio control of animals through the use of electrodes, as you yourselves are beginning to discover:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of recent discoveries, the creators decided to appear as little as possible in order not to influence the destiny of Man too much, so that they could see if they would reach the age of scientific knowledge on their own. So, the creators began to use increasingly discreet means of communicating with humans, as in the method of feeding Elijah using &quot;homing&quot; ravens.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of a gigantic experiment throughout the galaxy in which several humanities are in competition. The creators decided to appear less often, while at the same time reinforcing the authority and reputation of their ambassadors - the prophets - by using miracles. That is to say, scientific means which were then incomprehensible to the people of that era:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>See, your son lives!... Now by this I know that you are a man of God.</p>
<p><em>â€” 1 Kings 17: 23-24.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elijah had healed a young child who was dying. Later, he ordered two bull calves to be placed on logs at Mount Carmel, one to be consecrated to the idol Baal and the other to the creators. The one that would ignite by itself would represent the one true &quot;God&quot;.</p>
<p>Obviously, at a moment agreed upon in advance between Elijah and the creators, the Elohim's chosen log burst into flames, even though the wood was wet. This was accomplished by a powerful beam similar to a laser, emitted from a vessel hidden in the clouds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then the fire of Yahweh fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</p>
<p><em>â€” 1 Kings 18: 38.'</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="elijah-the-messenger"><a class="header" href="#elijah-the-messenger">Elijah the Messenger</a></h2>
<p>'The creators paid particular attention to Elijah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat. And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head.</p>
<p><em>â€” 1 Kings 19: 5-6.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this happened in the desert...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And, behold, Yahweh passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before Yahweh; but Yahweh was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but Yahweh was not in the earthquake: And after the earthquake a fire; but Yahweh was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.</p>
<p><em>â€” 1 Kings 19: 11-12.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There you have the exact description of a landing by a machine similar to one of your rockets. Then further on, a vision of the creators is described:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne, and all the host9 of heaven standing by him.</p>
<p><em>â€” 1 Kings 22: 19.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators once again used telepathy â€”this time group telepathyâ€” so that none of the prophets could predict the truth to the King:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.</p>
<p><em>â€” 1 Kings 22: 22.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Second Book of Kings</em>, there is further evidence of the protection, which the creators gave to Elijah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I be a man of Elohim, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of Elohim came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</p>
<p><em>â€” 2 Kings 1: 12.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This operation happened again, but the third time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the angel of Yahweh said unto Elijah10, Go down with him.</p>
<p><em>â€” 2 Kings 1: 15.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Second Book of Kings,</em> Chapter 2, Elijah is invited onto a spacecraft, which takes off with him on board:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Yahweh would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind.</p>
<p><em>â€” 2 Kings 2: 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</p>
<p><em>â€” 2 Kings 2: 11.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a spacecraft taking off, and when the narrator speaks of horses of fire, he is referring to the fire, which was emitted from the blast pipes. If you showed certain South American or African tribes people a rocket taking off, they would be incapable of understanding this scientific phenomenon in a rational way, and would look upon it as something supernatural, mystical, and divine. When returning to their tribes, they would speak of chariots of fire and horses of fire.</p>
<p>Further on in the <em>Second Book of Kings,</em> Chapter 4, Verses 32-7</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elisha, like his father, performs a resurrection. He heals and brings back to life a child who was dead. This happens quite frequently nowadays when mouth to mouth resuscitation and heart massage revive a person whose cardiac muscle has ceased to function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Elisha proceeds to multiply the bread.'</p>
<h2 id="the-multiplication-of-bread"><a class="header" href="#the-multiplication-of-bread">The Multiplication of Bread</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>'A man... brought the man of Elohim bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley... And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men?... He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith Yahweh, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof. So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of Yahweh.</p>
<p><em>â€” 2 Kings 4: 42-44.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators had brought synthetic dehydrated food with them, which when added to water, increased to five times its original volume. So with twenty small loaves of bread there was enough food for a hundred people.</p>
<p>You are already familiar with the little vitamin pills, which nourished your first astronauts. They take up very little space but contain all the necessary nutritional elements. One pill is enough to feed one person. A quantity equivalent in volume to one small loaf of bread is enough to feed five people. Therefore twenty loaves are sufficient to feed one hundred people.</p>
<p>But the people of Israel had begun adoring metal idols; they had also become cannibals and were completely immoral, much to the disgust of their creators:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So was Israel carried away out of their own land.</p>
<p><em>â€” 2 Kings 17: 23.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was the beginning of the dispersion of the Israelites whose civilization, instead of making progress, was constantly regressing, in contrast to their neighbors, who took advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>In the <em>Book of Isaiah</em> you again find:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also Yahweh sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up... Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.</p>
<p><em>â€” Isaiah 6: 1-2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is a description of the creators dressed in their one piece space suits fitted with six small jet engines, two on their backs, two on their hands, and two at their feet, these ones for steering purposes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: Yahweh of hosts mustereth the host of the battle. They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even Yahweh, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.</p>
<p><em>â€” Isaiah 13: 4-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole truth is encapsulated in that quote, it is just a matter of reading between the lines in order to understand. <em>They come from a far country, from the end of heaven</em>. That could not be clearer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of Elohim.</p>
<p><em>â€” Isaiah 14: 13.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the human scientists who had accumulated sufficient knowledge to undertake a trip to the creators' planet but were destroyed at Sodom and Gomorrah. The army of the heavens is described here at that time when they arrived with the weapons of wrath to destroy the whole country. It was those human scientists of Sodom and Gomorrah who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most high.</p>
<p><em>â€” Isaiah 14: 14.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the destruction prevented humans from equaling their creators, &quot;the most high&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That made the world as a wilderness.</p>
<p><em>â€” Isaiah 14: 17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nuclear explosion is described further on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beer-elim. For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood...</p>
<p><em>â€” Isaiah 15: 8-9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few were saved because they sheltered in bunkers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.</p>
<p><em>â€” Isaiah 26: 20.</em>'</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-flying-saucers-of-ezekiel"><a class="header" href="#the-flying-saucers-of-ezekiel">The Flying Saucers of Ezekiel</a></h2>
<p>'It is in the <em>Book of Ezekiel</em>, that we find the most interesting description of one of our flying machines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with flashing lightning, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst of it as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire. Out of the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. This was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man. Everyone had four faces, and everyone of them had four wings. Their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled like burnished brass. They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings [thus]: their wings were joined one to another; they didn't turn when they went; they went everyone straight forward.</p>
<p>As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle. Their faces and their wings were separate above; two [wings] of everyone were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies. They went everyone straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went; they didn't turn when they went. As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches: [the fire] went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</p>
<p>Now as I saw the living creatures, behold, one wheel on the eretz beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces of it. The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a bareket: and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel. When they went, they went in their four directions: they didn't turn when they went. As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about. When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the eretz, the wheels were lifted up. Wherever the spirit was to go, they went; there was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the eretz, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</p>
<p>Over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse, like the awesome crystal to look on, stretched forth over their heads above. Under the expanse were their wings straight, the one toward the other: everyone had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies. When they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of Shaddai, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings. There was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings. Above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sappir stone; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above. </p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel 1: 4-26.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There you have a description, which could not be more precise, of the creators who had come out of their flying machines. The &quot;stormy wind&quot; is the trace of smoke or vapor trail that present-day planes leave behind them at high altitudes. Then the machine appeared with its blinking light, the &quot;flashing lightning&quot; and &quot;glowing metal&quot;. Later, four creators appear wearing antigravity suits with small directional jet engines attached. These are described as the &quot;wings&quot; on their metal suits and &quot;their feet... sparkled like burnished brass&quot;. You have surely noticed how shiny the suits of your astronauts are.</p>
<p>As for the &quot;flying saucers&quot; or &quot;wheels&quot;, their appearance and their operation were not at all badly described considering it is a primitive person who is speaking. &quot;as it were a wheel within a wheel...they didn't turn when they went&quot;.</p>
<p>In the center of the flying saucer, very similar to the one in which we are now sitting, was the habitable section - the rim. &quot;they four had their rims full of eyes round about&quot;. In the same way that our clothing has evolved and we no longer wear those cumbersome space suits, our vessels then had portholes -the &quot;eyes&quot; around the rims- because we had not then discovered how to see through metallic walls by modifying their atomic structure at will.</p>
<p>The flying saucers stayed near the creators ready to help them if the need arose, since they were loading supplies and carrying out routine maintenance on the large intergalactic vessel above them. Other creators inside the vessels were directing them. &quot;...for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels&quot;. This is quite clear.</p>
<p>The suit described with its four portholes was similar to your first diving suits. &quot;Everyone had four faces... they didn't turn when they went&quot;.</p>
<p>The smaller saucers were something like your own LEMs - lunar excursion modules - small, short range vehicles used for exploratory missions. Above them the larger interplanetary vessel waited.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sappir stone; and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above.</p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel 1: 26.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The latter individual on the large vessel was supervising and coordinating the work of the creators. Frightened by all this, Ezekiel fell flat on his face before these things, which were so mysterious that they had to have come from no one other than &quot;God&quot;. But one of the creators said to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you... hear what I tell you... and eat that which I give you.</p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel 2: 1</em> and <em>7-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an image, like the eating from the tree of science of good and evil. It was intellectual food that he was given. In this case, it was a book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a hand stretched out to me; and behold, a scroll of a book was in it... there was writing on the inside and on the outside.</p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel 2: 9-10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was writing on both sides, a very surprising thing at that time when usually only one side of parchment was written on.</p>
<p>Then the scroll is &quot;eaten&quot;. This means that Ezekiel absorbed its meaning. What he learned is what you are learning now about humanity's origins. It was so exciting and comforting that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel 3: 3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Ezekiel is transported in the creators' vessel to the place where he was to spread the news:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing.</p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel 3: 12.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further on, the prophet is transported once again in a flying machine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of Elohim to Jerusalem. </p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel 8: 3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ezekiel noticed afterwards that beneath their &quot;wings&quot; the cherubims had hands like humans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings.</p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel 10: 8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside them...</p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel 10: 19.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me...</p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel 11: 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And the glory of Yahweh went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city. Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of Elohim into Chaldea...</p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel 11: 23-24.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There you have some of the many journeys of Ezekiel in one of the creators' flying machines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hand of Yahweh was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of Yahweh, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones.</p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel 37: 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here a miracle is about to happen. The creators go on to resurrect human beings whose only remains are their bones.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, each particle of a living being contains all the information to reconstruct it completely. All you have to do is place one of these particles, for example from bone remains, in a machine, which provides all the living matter required to reconstruct that
original being.</p>
<p>The machine supplies the matter, and the particle supplies all the required information, the blue-print according to which the being will be built, just as a spermatozoon contains all the information necessary to create a living being in the first place, right down to the color of the hair and eyes.</p>
<p>Son of man, can these bones live?... there was a noise, and behold a shaking... the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above... and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. <em>Ezekiel 37: 3-10.</em></p>
<p>All this is very easy to do, and you will do it some day. This is the origin of the ancient rituals in which elaborately protective sepulchers were built to bury great people, so that one day, they may be brought back to life everlasting. This is part of the secret of the &quot;tree of life&quot; â€” the secret of eternity.</p>
<p>In Chapter 40, Ezekiel is again carried away in a spacecraft, which takes him into the presence of someone wearing a space suit: Brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass...</p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel 40: 2-3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This &quot;city&quot; is one of the Earth bases that the creators used at that time. They were always located on very high mountains so that the creators would not be disturbed by humans. The man &quot;whose appearance was the appearance of brass&quot; is, of course, wearing a metallic suit. Similarly, due to our small stature, we were often mistaken for children or cherubs.</p>
<p>The priests in serving the creators in their terrestrial residence -the temple visited by Ezekiel- wore aseptic clothing when performing their duties, and those clothes always had to remain in the temple to avoid being contaminated by germs dangerous to the creators: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy.</p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel 42:14</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They should have written, &quot;for these garments are pure or sterile&quot;, but that was incomprehensible for primitive people who deified all that was told or shown to them at that period.</p>
<p>In <em>Ezekiel</em> Chapter 43, the big vessel, respectfully called &quot;the glory of God&quot;, approached.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone with His glory.</p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel, 43: 2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators did not want to be disturbed, so they issued a directive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because Yahweh, the Elohim of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.</p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel 44: 2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only a &quot;prince&quot; is allowed to come and speak with the creators: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before Yahweh.</p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel 44: 3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the prince had to pass through a chamber where he was disinfected by special rays:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.</p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel 44: 3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Levite priests were there to look after the creators:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood... and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me...</p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel 44: 15-16.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The odor of human perspiration was very unpleasant to the creators:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments... they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat.</p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel 44: 17-18.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a description also of how the Elohim's supply of fresh products continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first of all the firstfruits... ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house.</p>
<p><em>â€” Ezekiel 44: 30.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Chapter 3 of the <em>Book of Daniel,</em> King Nebuchadnezzar condemned three men to the stake for refusing to worship a metal god instead of the creators, whom he knew existed. But the three men were saved by one of the creators who came to their aid in the glowing fire, armed with a repellent and refrigerative ray. He protected them from the heat and the flames with this and allowed them to walk away totally unscathed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of Elohim.</p>
<p><em>â€” Daniel 3: 25.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further on, Daniel is cast into the lions' den, but the lions do not harm him. There again, nothing too complicated was involved, just a paralyzing beam to give enough time to get Daniel out of the den unharmed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My Elohim hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths.</p>
<p><em>â€” Daniel 6: 22.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the tenth chapter of <em>Daniel,</em> you will find another interesting description of a creator:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man... His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.</p>
<p><em>â€” Daniel 10: 5-6.'</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-last-judgement"><a class="header" href="#the-last-judgement">The Last Judgement</a></h2>
<p>'If the Hebrew people were dominated by the Persians and the Greeks, it was because of their lack of faith. Consequently, the Elohim punished the Hebrews by sending some of their &quot;angels&quot;  amongst the Persians and Greeks to help those nations to progress technologically.</p>
<p>This explains the great moments in the history of those two civilizations. The archangel Michael was the leader of the delegation, which was helping the Persians:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</p>
<p><em>â€” Daniel 10: 13.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Chapter 12 of <em>Daniel,</em> the resurrection is again mentioned: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.</p>
<p><em>â€” Daniel 12: 2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;Last Judgement&quot; will enable great individuals to live again. Those people who have acted positively for humanity and who have truly believed in their creators and followed their commandments will be welcomed with great joy by the people of the era when this will happen.</p>
<p>On the other hand, all the wicked people will feel shame before their judges and will live in eternal regret, as an example for the rest of humanity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.</p>
<p><em>â€” Daniel 12: 3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The geniuses will be the most highly esteemed and the most highly rewarded. Those just individuals, who allowed the geniuses to blossom, or the truth to triumph, will also be rewarded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.</p>
<p><em>â€” Daniel 12: 4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words will only be understood when humanity has reached a sufficient level of scientific understanding â€” that is to say, now. All this will happen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.</p>
<p><em>â€” Daniel 12: 7.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will be when the people of Israel recover their land after their long Diaspora. The state of Israel was created a few decades ago, at the same time as the explosion of humanity's scientific knowledge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.</p>
<p><em>â€” Daniel 12: 9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this will only be understood in this epoch. In recent years scientific progress and the beginning of space exploration by human beings have been such that everything seems possible for humanity. Nothing surprises people anymore, for they are used to seeing many wonders happening before their eyes on television. They can learn without astonishment that they really are made in the image of &quot;God&quot;, their almighty creator, and even as far as their scientific abilities are concerned. These days, miracles have become comprehensible.</p>
<p>In <em>Jonah</em>, the big fish that swallows the prophet is very interesting indeed. After Jonah was thrown into the water from a small boat: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now Yahweh had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</p>
<p><em>â€” Jonah 1: 17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;great fish&quot; was in reality a submarine, as you know such vessels now. But for the people of that time, it could only be a great fish, even though the gastric juices of such a fish would have digested a man quickly without any hope of his returning to the open air.  What is more, Jonah would have needed air to breathe. In the submarine, the creators were able to carry on a conversation with Jonah to learn about the political developments of those times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Yahweh spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.</p>
<p><em>â€” Jonah 2: 10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The submarine came close to the shore, and Jonah was back on land. In <em>Zechariah,</em> Chapter 5, there is another description of a flying machine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll... the length thereof is twenty cubits (9 meters) and the breadth thereof ten cubits (4.5 meters).</p>
<p><em>â€” Zechariah 5: 1-2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A little further on, women amongst the creators appear for the first time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork...</p>
<p><em>â€” Zechariah 5: 9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These two female companions were accompanying the creators and both were equipped with autonomous flying suits when they appeared before Zechariah.</p>
<p>In <em>Psalms</em> 8, Verse 5, it is said of human beings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Human beings are virtually as strong intellectually as their creators. Those who copied out the texts did not dare write &quot;equal&quot; to the Elohim as it had been originally dictated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it.</p>
<p><em>â€” Psalms 19: 6.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators came from a planet very far away from the Earth's orbit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun.</p>
<p><em>â€” Psalms 19: 4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is another allusion to the mass of Earth, which was created to form the original continent when the oceans covered the Earth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yahweh looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men. From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.</p>
<p><em>â€” Psalms 33: 13-14.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators watch humanity's behavior as they always have done from their flying vessels.'</p>
<h2 id="satan"><a class="header" href="#satan">Satan</a></h2>
<p>'In the <em>Book of Job</em>, Chapter 1, you have the explanation of Satan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now there was a day when the sons of Elohim came to present themselves before Yahweh, and Satan came also among them.</p>
<p><em>â€” Job 1: 6.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elohim in Hebrew literally means &quot;those who came from the sky&quot;. The &quot;sons of Elohim&quot;, in other words, the creators who watch human beings, report regularly to their planet of origin, indicating for the most part that human beings venerate and love the Elohim. But one of these Elohim, called Satan, was part of a group, which had always condemned the creation of other intelligent beings on a planet as close as the Earth, seeing them as a possible threat. That is why, on seeing Job's devotion, which was one of the best examples of human
beings loving their creators, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doth Job fear Elohim for nought?... But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. And Yahweh said unto Satan, 'Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand.'</p>
<p><em>â€” Job 1: 9-12.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hearing Satan's assertion that had Job not been rich, he would not have loved his creators, the government gave full power to Satan to ruin Job. It would then be seen if he still venerated his creators, and that is why killing him was forbidden.</p>
<p>On seeing Job's dedication to respecting his creators, even when he was ruined, the government triumphed over the opposition, Satan. But Satan retorted that though Job had lost many things, he was still in good health. So the government gave Satan <em>carte blanche</em> so long as he did not kill Job:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.</p>
<p><em>â€” Job 2: 6.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, in the <em>Book of Job</em>, a small sentence in Chapter 37 is very interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Him, have you spread out the skies, Strong as a cast metal mirror?</p>
<p><em>â€” Job 37: 18</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, are human beings capable of making a &quot;cast metal mirror&quot; â€” in reality flying metallic vessels? People of that time thought it was possible for no one but God. And yet today it can be done.</p>
<p>Finally, in view of Job's humility, the creators healed him and gave him back his wealth, his children and his health.'</p>
<h2 id="humans-could-not-understand"><a class="header" href="#humans-could-not-understand">Humans Could Not Understand</a></h2>
<p>'In the <em>Book of Tobit</em> in the Apocryhpha, one of the creators' robots named Raphael also came to test humanity's reaction towards its creators.</p>
<p>Once he had accomplished his mission, he left, after proving who he was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All these days I did appear unto you; but I did neither eat nor drink... for I go up to him that sent me; but write all things which are done in a book.</p>
<p><em>â€” Tobit 12: 19-20.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of this is easy to see in the writings. But once again you must try to understand.</p>
<p>As for wisdom, what she is, and how she came up, I will tell you, and will not hide mysteries from you: but will seek her out from the beginning of her nativity, and bring the knowledge of her into light, and will not pass over the truth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>â€” Wisdom of Solomon 6: 22.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the time comes, &quot;wisdom&quot;, the science, which allowed all this to happen, will be known by Man. The biblical writings will be proof of all this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For by the greatness and beauty of the creatures proportionably the maker of them is seen.</p>
<p><em>â€” Wisdom of Solomon 13: 5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it is simple to see the truth, recognizing the creators by observing their creations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And could not out of the good things that are seen know him that is.</p>
<p><em>â€” Wisdom of Solomon 13: 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To avoid being disturbed by humans, the creators built their bases on high mountains, where we now find traces of great civilizations (in the Himalayas and Peru, for example), as well as at the bottom of the sea. Gradually the mountain stations were abandoned in favor of submarine bases less accessible to humans. The creators who had been banished at the outset had hidden themselves in the oceans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In that day Yahweh with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.</p>
<p><em>â€” Isaiah 27: 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At that time the government of their planet wanted to destroy those who had created the humans.</p>
<p>It was not easy to see clearly among all those wonders, so of course, the creators were deified and made into something abstract because human beings were unable to understand scientific facts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.</p>
<p><em>â€” Isaiah 29: 12.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a long time, humanity has held the truth in its hands but could not understand until it was sufficiently evolved scientifically to decode it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every man is brutish in his knowledge...</p>
<p><em>â€” Jeremiah 10: 14.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Science enabled the creators to create and will enable human beings to do the same.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was... When he prepared the heavens, I was there... When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment... Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.</p>
<p><em>â€” Proverbs 8: 22-23, 27, 29 -31.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intelligence and science, these are the two virtues that enabled the creators to create the landmass - the single continent - and the living beings they placed upon it. And now this intelligence and this spirit leads the human brain to repeat the acts of their creators.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of time it has been so: people create other people like themselves on other planets. The cycle continues. Some die, others take over. We are your creators, and you will create other humanities:</p>
<p>That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been. <em>Ecclesiastes 3: 15.</em></p>
<p>The animals were also created and will be recreated. Just like human beings, no more, no less. The species that disappear will live again when you know how to recreate them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.</p>
<p><em>â€” Ecclesiastes 3: 19.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We, the creators, will only show ourselves officially if humanity is grateful to us for having created them. We fear that human beings might hold a grudge against us, which we cannot accept.</p>
<p>We would like to begin making open contact with you and give you the benefit of our considerable advance in scientific knowledge â€” so long as we could be sure that you would not turn against us, and that you would love us as your parents.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker!... Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands? Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou?</p>
<p><em>â€” Isaiah 45: 9-10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fear of not being loved by human beings has led your creators to allow you to progress scientifically by yourselves, with almost no help.</p>
<p>The emblem you see engraved on this machine and on my suit represents the truth. It is also the emblem of the Jewish people, the Star of David, which means: &quot;That which is above is like that which is below&quot;, and in its center is the swastika, which means that everything is cyclic, the top becoming the bottom, and the bottom in turn becoming the top. The origins and destiny of the creators and human beings are similar and linked.</p>
<p>Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth? <em>Isaiah 40: 21.</em></p>
<p>The traces of the creators' bases on high mountains is mentioned in the <em>Book of Amos:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He that... treadeth upon the high places of the earth.</p>
<p><em>â€” Amos 4: 13.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators had seven bases in all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those seven; they are the eyes of Yahweh, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</p>
<p><em>â€” Zechariah 4: 10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the origin of the seven-branched candlestick, the meaning of which has been lost. In the beginning at the creators' headquarters, there was a switchboard with seven lighted switches enabling them to stay in contact with the other bases and with the interplanetary vessel orbiting the Earth.</p>
<p>In <em>Psalms,</em> 139:4-6, there is an allusion to telepathy: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Yahweh, thou knowest it altogether. Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>At that time telepathy was unimaginable, hence &quot;such knowledge is too wonderful for me&quot;. Astronomy and interplanetary journeys were also unthinkable at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names. Great is our Yahweh, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.</p>
<p><em>â€” Psalms 147: 4-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Human beings were also unable to understand telecommunication:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly.</p>
<p><em>â€” Psalms 147: 15.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We now reach a decisive turning point in the creators' work. They decided at that period to let humanity progress scientifically without ever intervening directly. They understood that they themselves had been created in the same way, and that by creating similar beings to themselves, they were allowing the cycle to continue.</p>
<p>But first, in order for the truth to be spread throughout the world, they decided to send a Messiah who would be able to communicate worldwide what the people of Israel were then the only ones to know.</p>
<p>This was in preparation for the day when the original mystery would be explained in the light of scientific progress - that is to say, the revelation. So they announced him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting... And he shall stand and feed in the strength of Yahweh... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth. And this man shall be the peace.</p>
<p><em>â€” Micah 5: 2-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee...lowly, and riding upon an ass... and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea.</p>
<p><em>â€” Zechariah 9: 9-10.</em> '</p>

<h2 id="the-conception"><a class="header" href="#the-conception">The Conception</a></h2>
<p>The next morning, we met again at the same spot, and my host said: 'Christ's role was to spread the truth of the biblical scriptures throughout the world, so that they could serve as proof for all of humanity when the age of science would finally explain everything. The creators therefore decided to arrange for a child to be born of a woman of the Earth and one of their own people. The child in question would thereby inherit certain telepathic faculties, which humans lack:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 1: 18.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mary was the woman chosen, and obviously her fiance found these tidings hard to accept, but:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold, the angel of Yahweh appeared unto him.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 1:20.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the creators appeared to explain that Mary would bring forth a son of &quot;God&quot;. The prophets, who were in contact with the creators, came from very far away to see the divine child. One of the spacecrafts of the creators guided them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him... the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 2: 2 and 9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators watched over the child:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The angel of Yahweh appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 2: 13.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The king was not too happy about the child-king coming from the people on his territory, which was announced to him by the prophets. But after King Herod died, the creators told Joseph that he could return to Israel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of Yahweh appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 2: 19-20.</em>'</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-initiation"><a class="header" href="#the-initiation">The Initiation</a></h2>
<p>'When he came of age, Jesus was led to the creators, so that they could reveal to him his true identity, introduce him to his father, reveal his mission and make known to him various scientific techniques.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of Yahweh descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: And lo a voice from heaven, saying, 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.' Then was Jesus16 led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil...</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 3: 16-17 and 4: 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The devil, &quot;Satan&quot;, the creator of whom we spoke previously, was always convinced that nothing good could come of humanity on Earth. He was &quot;Satan the skeptic&quot;, and he was supported by the government's opposition on our distant planet.</p>
<p>So he tested Jesus to find out if his intelligence was positive, and if he really loved and respected his creators. Having discovered that they could place complete confidence in Jesus, Jesus was allowed to go and accomplish his mission.</p>
<p>In order to rally people to him, Jesus performed &quot;miracles&quot;, which in reality, were the application of scientific teachings shown to him by the creators:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And they brought unto him all sick people... and he healed them.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 4: 24.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Blessed are the poor in spirit.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 5: 3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sentence has been incorrectly interpreted as &quot;the poor are blessed&quot;. But the original meaning was that if the poor have spirit, then they will be happy - which is totally different.</p>
<p>Then Jesus told his apostles that they must spread the truth throughout the world. In the prayer called the &quot;Lord's Prayer&quot; or the &quot;Our Father&quot;, the truth is stated literally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 6: 10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In &quot;heaven&quot;, on the creators' planet, the scientists eventually became the ruling group and then created other intelligent beings.</p>
<p>The same thing will happen on Earth. The torch will be taken up again.</p>
<p>This prayer, which has been repeated time and time again without anyone understanding its profound meaning, now takes on its full significance: <em>On Earth, as it is in heaven.</em></p>
<p>Amongst other things, Jesus had been taught to speak convincingly through a type of telepathic group hypnosis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And so it was, when Jesus had ended these sayings, that the people were astonished at His teaching, for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 7: 28-29.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He continued to heal the sick with the help of the creators who directed concentrated beams from a distance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A leper came and worshiped Him, saying, &quot;Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying, 'I am willing; be cleansed.' Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 8: 2-3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he did the same for a man who was completely paralyzed. The operation was carried out from a distance using a concentrated ray, something like a laser, which burns only one spot through several layers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arise, take up thy bed... And he arose.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 9: 6-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further on in <em>St. Matthew's Gospel</em>, Jesus announced his mission: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 9: 13.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He did not come for the people of Israel, who knew of the existence of the creators, but rather, so that this knowledge would be spread throughout the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Later there were more &quot;miracles&quot;, somewhat similar to the first ones, all of which were medical. Nowadays there are transplants of hearts and other organs; leprosy and other similar illnesses are cured, and people are brought out of a coma with appropriate care. These would be considered miracles by technologically primitive people. At that time human beings were primitive, and the creators were similar to people of your present &quot;civilized&quot; nations, although a little more advanced scientifically.</p>
<p>Further on we find an allusion to the creators among whom is Jesus' real father:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every one therefore who shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 10: 32.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Before my Father who is in heaven</em> â€” this says it all. In fact, &quot;God&quot; is not intangible or immaterial. He is &quot;in heaven&quot;. This is obviously incomprehensible to people who, at the time, believed that the stars were attached to a heavenly canopy just like pretty light bulbs, all rotating around the center of the world - the Earth. Now, since the advent of space travel and an understanding of the immensity of the universe, the old texts are brought to light in a completely different way.'</p>
<h2 id="parallel-humanities"><a class="header" href="#parallel-humanities">Parallel Humanities</a></h2>
<p>'In <em>St. Matthew's Gospel</em>, Chapter 13, there is an important passage where Jesus explains in a parable how the creators left their planet to create life on other worlds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold, a sower went forth to sow; And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up: Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them: But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 13: 3-9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this is an allusion to the various attempts to create life on other planets â€” and three of them failed.</p>
<p>The first failed because of the birds, which came and ate the seeds.</p>
<p>In fact, this was a failure caused by the proximity of the planet in question to the creators' original planet. Those who were against the creation of people similar to themselves saw a possible threat in the experiment and therefore went to destroy the creation.</p>
<p>The second attempt was made on a planet too near a sun that was too hot; therefore, their creation was destroyed by noxious radiation.</p>
<p>The third attempt was made &quot;among thorns&quot; on a planet, which was far too humid, where the plant life was so powerful that it destroyed the equilibrium and the animal world. This world consisting only of plants still exists.</p>
<p>But the fourth attempt was finally successful on &quot;good ground&quot;.</p>
<p>And it is important to note that there were in fact three successes in all. This means that on two other planets, which are relatively near to you, there are living beings similar to yourselves who were created by the same creators.</p>
<p>&quot;Who hath ears to hear, let him hear&quot;; those who are able, understand. When the time comes, those who seek to understand will do so. The others, those who look without really seeing, and hear without really listening or understanding, such people will not understand the truth. On the other hand, those who prove their intelligence by their own efforts and thus show themselves to be worthy
of their creators' help, they will be helped.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 13: 12</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The people who will not be able to prove their intelligence will not survive. Humans have almost proved that they are worthy of being recognized by their creators as their equals. They lack only... a little love. Love for each other, and particularly for their creators.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 13: 11.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The three planets, on which life has been created, have been set in competition against one another. The planet on which humanity makes the most scientific progress, thereby proving its intelligence, will receive the benefit of their creators' inheritance on the day of the &quot;last judgement&quot; â€” so long as they do not behave aggressively towards their creators.</p>
<p>This will be the day when their knowledge will have reached a sufficiently high level. At present human beings on Earth are not very far away from that day. Human genius is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 13: 32.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;birds of the air&quot; here refers to the creators who will come and lodge in the branches; that is to say, will come to give their knowledge to humanity when humanity shows itself worthy of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 13: 33.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another allusion to the three worlds in which the creators are waiting for science to bloom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 13: 35</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we have something fundamentally important. Planets have a life span, and one day they will no longer be habitable. By that time humanity must have reached a level of scientific knowledge sufficient either to undertake a move to another planet, or if it cannot adapt itself elsewhere, to create a humanoid form of life capable of surviving on another world. If the environment cannot be adapted to suit people, then people must be created who are compatible with the new environment.</p>
<p>Before humanity becomes extinct, you would, for example, have to create another race of people capable of living in a totally different atmosphere, who would inherit your knowledge before you disappear. So that this inheritance would not be lost, the creators put life on three worlds, and only the best one will be entitled to the inheritance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 13: 49.</em>'</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="scientific-miracles"><a class="header" href="#scientific-miracles">Scientific Miracles</a></h2>
<p>'The passage concerning the multiplication of bread has already been explained. It refers to concentrated food products in the form of large pills, rather like those containing all the vital elements, which your astronauts use. Your &quot;Holy Bread&quot; hosts are reminiscent of these pills. With the equivalent of a few loaves of bread, there is enough to feed thousands of people.</p>
<p>When Jesus walked on the water, the creators supported him using an anti-gravity beam, which cancelled the effect of weight at a precise point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He came unto them, walking upon the sea.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 14: 25.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The beam, in fact, created a turbulence, which is described as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But when he saw the wind boisterous, he (Peter) was afraid... And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 14: 30-32.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;wind ceased&quot; as they boarded the boat, because the beam was switched off when Jesus reached it. Another totally scientific &quot;miracle&quot;.</p>
<p>In reality, there are no such things as miracles, only differences in levels of civilization. If you had landed at the time of Jesus in a spacecraft, or even a simple helicopter, even though your level of scientific development may have been limited, you would, in the eyes of the people of that time, have been performing miracles.</p>
<p>Just by producing artificial light, coming from the sky, driving a car, watching television, or even by killing a bird with a gun, because they would have been incapable of understanding the mechanism behind such phenomena, people of the time would have seen in them a divine or supernatural force. Also do not forget that the same scientific gap which exists between you and the people at the time of Jesus, also exists now between you and us. We can still do things, which you would consider &quot;miracles&quot;.</p>
<p>But for the most advanced individuals among you, they would no longer really be miracles since for the last few decades, you have taken the path of science and are trying to grasp the reason behind things instead of dumbly prostrating yourselves on your bellies and bringing offerings.</p>
<p>Our knowledge, however, remains such that if we decided to perform a few miracles, even your most eminent scientists would be unable to understand how we did them. There are some particularly well developed minds who would be able to cope with such things, but people in general would simply panic, and we are still capable of astonishing people, even though they are no longer so easily shocked.</p>
<p>It is necessary for people to understand that there is no ethereal &quot;God&quot;, but only people who created other people in their image.</p>
<p>In Chapter 17 of <em>St. Matthew's Gospel,</em> the creators appear once again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart: and he was transfigured before them; and his face did shine as the sun, and his garments became white as the light... And behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him... behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, 'This is my beloved Son... hear ye him.'</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 17: 1-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This scene happens at night, and the apostles are all frightened to see Jesus illuminated by the powerful searchlights of the spacecraft, out of which Moses and Elijah stepped, still alive thanks to the tree of life from which they had benefited. Immortality is a scientific reality, even if it does not correspond to humanity's idea of immortality.</p>
<p>In Chapter 19, Verse 30 of <em>St. Matthew,</em> there is a sentence: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that the created shall become creators just as the creators were created.'</p>
<h2 id="deserving-the-inheritance"><a class="header" href="#deserving-the-inheritance">Deserving the Inheritance</a></h2>
<p>'In Chapter 25, Verses 14-29 of <em>St. Matthew's Gospel</em>, it is said that the three planets must make scientific progress, and they will be judged one day. We read in the parable: Leaving for a trip, a man entrusted three of his slaves with his goods.The first one received five talents; the second, two talents; the third, one talent.</p>
<p>When the master returns, the first gave back to him the five talents and shows him five others which he won. The second gave him back the two talents plus two others that he won. The third gave him back only one talent, the one that was given to him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Out of the three worlds where life has been created, the one which makes the most progress will receive the inheritance. The ones which have not progressed will be dominated by the other and eliminated.</p>
<p>This is also true on Earth between peoples.</p>
<p>In <em>St. Matthew's Gospel,</em> Chapter 26, Jesus reveals the importance of his death and of the writings, which would later serve as proof. When one of his companions tried to defend him with a sword, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 26: 52-54.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was in fact necessary for Jesus to die in order for the truth to be known throughout the world so that later on, when your creators return to Earth, they are not taken for usurpers or invaders. That is the purpose of the biblical and evangelical writings: to preserve traces of the work and presence of your creators, so that they will be recognized when they return.</p>
<p>After his death, Jesus was resuscitated with the help of the creators:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of Yahweh descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 28: 2-3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators took care of Jesus and revived him. And he said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations... Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 28: 19-20.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus' mission was coming to an end:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So then after Jesus16 had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven.</p>
<p><em>â€” Mark 16: 19.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators took him away after this last most important phrase: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</p>
<p><em>â€” Mark 16: 18.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to humanity discovering anti-venom serums and antidotes, and developing surgery and so on â€” as is happening now.</p>
<p>In preparation for their arrival on Earth, the creators will appear more and more frequently, in order to highlight these revelations.</p>
<p>This also is happening right now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold the fig tree... When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.</p>
<p><em>â€” Luke 21: 29-30.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When unidentified flying objects begin appearing in large numbers, as they are doing at present, it means that the time has come. In the <em>Acts of the Apostles</em>, it says, furthermore, in Chapter 2: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues...</p>
<p><em>â€” Acts 2: 1-4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make it possible for the apostles to spread the truth throughout the world, the creators exposed them to a concentrated burst of teaching sent to them by amplified telepathic waves, a little like electro-shocks, which impregnated their memories with elements of other languages.</p>
<p>In the <em>Acts of the Apostles,</em> note the numerous appearances made by the creators -the &quot;angels&quot;- particularly when they liberated Peter, who had been chained up by Herod:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And, behold, the angel of Yahweh came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands. And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me. And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.</p>
<p><em>â€” Acts 12: 7- 9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peter, primitive as he was, thought he was having a vision as his chains fell off. He did not know about the electric laser welding torch, which was being used by one of the creators. When such fantastic things happen, people think they are dreaming. This is why it was often said that people who have seen the creators must have had a vision or seen them in a dream. In the same way, it is said that people who have seen our flying saucers must have had hallucinations. In that quotation, it is clearly explained that Peter thought he had seen everything in a dream, but in fact, it was all very real.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord... and forthwith the angel departed from him.</p>
<p><em>â€” Acts 12: 10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another sign that the time has come is that the people of Israel have regained their country:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down.</p>
<p><em>â€” Acts 15: 16.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another important sentence is found in a following chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For we are also his offspring.</p>
<p><em>â€” Acts 17: 28</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was said by an apostle while speaking of &quot;God&quot;.</p>
<p>We shall not continue to read further in the Gospels where there are many more references to the creators, because they are less important. You can interpret them yourself for those who ask questions in the light of the explanations I have already given you.'</p>
<p>And saying that, he left, just as on previous occasions.</p>

<p>The next day, he returned just as before and started to speak:</p>
<p>'The time of the end of the world has arrived. Not the end of the world as in a catastrophe destroying the Earth, but the end of the world of the Church, which has completed its work. It performed this role more or less effectively. It was a task of vulgarization, making it possible for your creators to be recognized when they return. As you have noticed, the Christian church is dying. It is the end of this world because its mission has been fulfilled, albeit with quite a few mistakes because it tried for so long to deify the creators.</p>
<p>This deification was acceptable until the scientific age began. Then it should have been removed completely. This would have been possible had the truth been preserved, or if people had been able to read between the lines. But too many mistakes were made.</p>
<p>This was foreseen by the creators, and the Church will collapse because it is no longer of any use. In scientifically developed countries, people are already consumed by a kind of moroseness because they have nothing left to believe in. Nobody can believe in a &quot;Heavenly God&quot; any longer, perched upon a cloud with a white beard, omniscient and omnipotent, which is what the Church wants us to do. Neither can anybody believe in delightful little guardian angels, nor in a devil with horns and hooves. So nobody knows what to believe in any more. Only a few young people have understood that love is essential. You have reached the golden age.</p>
<p>People of the Earth, you fly in the heavens, and your voices are carried to the four corners of the Earth by means of radio waves. So the time has come for you to know the truth.</p>
<p>As it has been foretold, everything is happening now that the Earth has entered the Age of Aquarius. Certain people have already written about this, but no one believed them. Some 22,000 years ago, your creators decided to start their work on Earth, and everything that has happened since was anticipated because the movement of the galaxy implies this knowledge.</p>
<p>The Age of Pisces was the age of Christ and his fishermen, and the Age of Aquarius, which follows, began in 1946. This is the era in which the people of Israel found their country again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And it shall come to pass in that day... that there shall be the noise of a cry from the pisces gate...</p>
<p><em>â€” Zephaniah 1: 10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Gate of Pisces is the passageway into the Age of Aquarius. This is the moment when the Sun rises over the Earth on the day of the vernal equinox in the constellation of Aquarius. The loud clamor is the sound accompanying this revelation.</p>
<p>It is not by chance that you were born in 1946.'</p>
<h2 id="the-end-of-the-church"><a class="header" href="#the-end-of-the-church">The End of the Church</a></h2>
<p>'This revelation, thanks to the enlightenment it contains, will bring back hope and happiness to people who are morose. But it will also hasten the fall of the Church - unless the Church can understand its mistakes and place itself at the service of the truth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off: That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought.</p>
<p><em>â€” Isaiah 29: 20-21.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the end of those people who want to make us believe in original sin and who want to make us feel guilty; the end for people who lay traps for those who spread the truth at the end of the Age of Pisces and the beginning of the Age of Aquarius; the end of people who are trying to save the Church as it existed, while ousting the just â€” those who speak of justice and those who write or preach the truth.</p>
<p>They are like the people who crucified Jesus. Such people were convinced that they were defending what was right without trying to understand and were frightened of being ruined and destroyed at the dawning of the Age of Pisces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken... The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful... For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against Yahweh, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail. The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right. But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand.</p>
<p><em>â€” Isaiah 32: 3-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone in this case will understand the words: &quot;the eyes of them that see shall not be dim&quot;. It is the Church who speaks of Yahweh deceitfully and leaves empty the souls of those who are hungry for the truth.</p>
<p>It is the Church, which devises infamous plans to annihilate the poor, so that those who are unable to understand or who dare not understand, will remain faithful to it through the fear of sin, excommunication or other such nonsensical things. While the poor try to plead their case, those who lack the intelligence to seize the truth stand up for the lies of the Church at the Church's bidding. But those of noble mind, those who loudly proclaim the truth, they perform noble acts, even though they may live without the approval of the agonizing Church of Man.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?</p>
<p><em>â€” Isaiah 40: 21.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold my servant whom I uphold, mine elect [in whom] my soul delighteth! I will put my Spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgment to the nations.</p>
<p><em>â€” Isaiah 42: 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are the one who will spread the truth throughout the world, this truth which has been revealed to you over the past few days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A bruised reed will he not break, and a dimly burning wick will he not quench.</p>
<p><em>â€” Isaiah 42: 3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will not be able to destroy the Church and its lies completely, but eventually, it will fade out by itself. This extinction has been going on for some time. The &quot;wick&quot; is weakening. It has  accomplished its mission, and it is time for it to disappear. It has made mistakes and has enriched itself at the expense of the truth, without trying to interpret it in a clear enough way for people of this era. But do not be too hard on it, for thanks to the Church, the word of the Bible, which is a witness to the truth, has spread throughout the world.</p>
<p>Its mistakes have been great, particularly when it injected too much of the supernatural into the truth, and wrongly translated the scriptures in ordinary Bibles. It replaced the term &quot;Elohim&quot;, which refers to the creators, with a singular term &quot;God&quot;, whereas in fact Elohim in Hebrew is the plural of Eloha.</p>
<p>In this way, the Church transformed the creators into a single incomprehensible God. Another mistake was to make people adore a wooden cross in memory of Jesus Christ. A cross is not the Christ. A piece of wood in the shape of a cross means nothing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And none taketh it to heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire, and have also baked bread upon the coals thereof, I have roasted flesh, and eaten, and with the rest thereof shall I make an abomination? shall I bow down to a block of wood?</p>
<p><em>â€” Isaiah 44: 19.</em> '</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-creation-of-the-state-of-israel"><a class="header" href="#the-creation-of-the-state-of-israel">The Creation of the State of Israel</a></h2>
<p>'The return of the Jewish people to Israel, as it was predicted, is a sign of the golden age:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west; I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth; Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory.</p>
<p><em>â€” Isaiah 43: 5-7.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is indeed the creation of the state of Israel welcoming Jews from the north and from the south. The Bible, preserved by the Jewish people, bears witness to the coming of the creators as it is written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ye are my witnesses.</p>
<p><em>â€” Isaiah 43: 10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears. Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth. Ye are my witnesses, saith Yahweh, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he... therefore ye are my witnesses, saith Yahweh, that I am El. Yea, before the day was I am he.</p>
<p><em>â€” Isaiah 43: 8-13.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Ye are my witnesses.&quot; That is quite explicit, isn't it? And I can tell you again on this day - from ancient days I am one and the same â€” thanks to the witness that you hold in your hand, the Bible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.</p>

<p>The people of Israel have, in fact, regained their country after having participated in safeguarding the truth.</p>
<p>The time when humanity will overcome illness by scientific means is predicted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days.</p>
<p><em>â€” Isaiah 65: 20.</em></p>

<p>Medicine now helps people triumph over illness and especially over infant mortality.</p>

<h2 id="the-mistakes-of-the-church"><a class="header" href="#the-mistakes-of-the-church">The Mistakes of the Church</a></h2>
<p>'The Church was sinful in making human beings feel guilty and making them pray without seeking to understand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 6: 7.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And despite the warning in the <em>Gospels,</em> the Church has also made itself too wealthy, while it was written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth... No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve Yahweh and mammon.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 6: 19-24.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 10: 9-10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But with their stupid rules and meatless Fridays, they didn't respect their own <em>Gospels</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 15: 11.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How dare they, these men who are only men, indulge themselves in the wealth and luxury of the Vatican when the <em>Gospels</em> tell them to possess &quot;neither gold, nor silver&quot; - not even a spare coat?</p>
<p>How dare they preach goodness?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Jesus said unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, It is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 19: 23.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. But all their works they do for to be seen of men... and love the uppermost rooms at feasts... and greetings in the markets... for one is your Master, even Christ; and all you are brothers. And call no man your father on the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven. Neither be you called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ. But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.</p>
<p><em>â€” Matthew 23: 4-11.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is all written in their own <em>Gospels</em>. So how dare the Church burden people with their so called sins, which are only different concepts of morality and lifestyles; how dare they speak of goodness while living in opulence in the Vatican when people are dying of hunger; how dare they seek invitations and honors while preaching humility; how dare they ask people to call them &quot;Father&quot;, &quot;Your Eminence&quot;, or &quot;Your Holiness&quot;, when their Gospels expressly forbid all these things?</p>
<p>If tomorrow the Pope took to the road as a pauper, the Church would be revived, but it would have a totally different humanitarian goal to that which it has pursued up to now â€” namely the propagation of what must serve as proof for today.</p>
<p>That mission is finished, but the Church can re-orientate itself towards goodness by helping those who are unhappy, by helping to spread the real truth of those writings, which until now, have been distorted or kept secret. In this way, the generous spirit of many priests would find fulfillment. For that to happen, the men of the Vatican should set an example by selling all their treasures to help finance underdeveloped countries. They should go to those countries and help people progress by offering practical help with their bare hands not just with &quot;the good word&quot;.</p>
<p>It is unacceptable too that there are different categories of marriage and more particularly of burials, according to a person's wealth. This is another mistake of the Church.</p>
<p>But the time has come.'</p>
<h2 id="at-the-root-of-all-religions"><a class="header" href="#at-the-root-of-all-religions">At the Root of All Religions</a></h2>
<p>'It is not only in the Bible and the Gospels that there are traces of the truth; testimonies can be found in practically every religion. The Kabala especially is one of the richest in testimonies, but it would not have been easy for you to get hold of one.</p>
<p>If one day you can find a copy, then you will be able to see that there are a great number of allusions to us. Particularly noteworthy is a description in the <em>Canticle of Canticles</em> (5) of the creators' planet and the distance which separates it from Earth.</p>
<p>It is written that the &quot;height of the creator&quot; is 236,000 &quot;parasangs&quot;, and that &quot;the height of his heels&quot; is 30,000,000 &quot;parasangs&quot;. The parasang is a unit of measurement just like the parsec, which stands for the distance that light can travel in one second, which is about 300,000 kilometers. Our planet is 30,000,000 parasangs away from Earth or about nine thousand billion kilometers, just a little less than
a light year.</p>
<p>By moving at the speed of light, or 300,000 kilometers per second, you would take almost one year to reach our planet. With your present day rockets, which travel at only 40,000 kilometers per hour, it would take you about 26,000 years to reach our planet.</p>
<p>So you can see that we have nothing to fear for the time being. We have the means to travel to Earth from our planet in less than two months with an atom-based propulsion method, which enables us to move at the speed of rays that are seven times faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>Those rays &quot;carry&quot; us. To be carried by them, we leave the optical window, which is the spectrum of rays detected by the eye, to tune into the carrying beam. That is why people on Earth who have observed our spaceships have described them as becoming luminous, then very brilliant white, then blue, and finally disappearing.</p>
<p>Obviously when a spacecraft goes beyond the speed of light, it disappears and is no longer visible to the naked eye. That is the &quot;height of the creator's heels&quot;, the distance at which his heels, so to speak, rest on a planet.</p>
<p>The creators' own planet is 236,000 parasangs from its sun - a very big star - or seventy billion, eight hundred million kilometers. This is what is meant by the &quot;height&quot; of the creators.</p>
<p>The Kabala is the closest book to the truth, but almost all religious books allude to us with varying degrees of clarity. This is especially true in those countries where the creators had bases - in the Andes, in the Himalayas, in Greece where Greek mythology also contains important testimonies, as well as in the Buddhist and Islamic religions and among the Mormons. It would take many pages to name all the religions and sects that testify in a more or less obscure way to our work.'</p>
<h2 id="mankind-a-disease-of-the-universe"><a class="header" href="#mankind-a-disease-of-the-universe">Mankind: A Disease of the Universe</a></h2>
<p>'There, now you know the truth. You must write it down and make it known throughout the world. If people on Earth want us to give them the benefit of our experience and help them gain 25,000 years of scientific knowledge, they have to show us that they want to meet us, and above all demonstrate that they deserve it, and that all this can be done without any danger to us.</p>
<p>If we give our knowledge to humanity, we have to be sure they will make good use of it. Our observations in recent years have not shown that wisdom rules the Earth. Certainly there has been progress, but some people still die of hunger, and a warlike spirit still exists throughout the world. We know that our arrival could improve many things and unite nations, but we have to feel that people really want to see us, and that they are truly starting to unify.</p>
<p>We also have to feel that they really want to see us arrive, knowing fully who we are and understanding the true meaning of our arrival.</p>
<p>Several times human warplanes have tried to chase our crafts, taking us for enemies.</p>
<p>You must tell them who we are, so that we can show ourselves without any risk of either getting hurt or killed -which is not the case at present- or of creating a dangerous and murderous panic.</p>
<p>Some researchers want to contact us by radio, but we do not respond because in this way they could locate our planet. On the other hand, transmission times would be too long, and our broadcasting system uses waves that your technology cannot pick up because you have not yet discovered them. They are seven times faster than radio waves, and we are experimenting with new waves that are one and a half times faster than that.</p>
<p>Progress continues, and our own research continues for the purpose of understanding and relating to the large being of whom we are a part, and on whose atoms we are parasites. These atoms are the planets and the stars. In fact, we have been able to discover that intelligent living beings in the infinitely small live on particles that are planets and suns to them. They ask the same questions as ourselves. Humanity is a disease inside this gigantic being, and the planets and stars are its atoms. Also this same gigantic being is in its turn a parasite on other greater atoms. In both directions, it is infinite. But the important thing is to make sure that the disease, which is humanity, continues to exist and never dies.</p>
<p>We did not know when we were creating you that we were accomplishing a secondary mission &quot;written&quot; into us, thus repeating what had been done for us. From what we created and how it has developed, we have discovered our own origins. For we were also created by other people who have since disappeared. Their world has quite certainly disintegrated, but thanks to them, we were able to continue in their steps and create you.</p>
<p>We may disappear one day, but by then you will have replaced us and taken over our roles. So you are the link in the precious chain of human continuity. Other worlds exist, and humanity is certainly developing in other parts of the universe.</p>
<p>But in this region of the universe, our world is the only one to have made new creations. This is important because, from each world, innumerable children can be brought forth who are precious for preserving continuity. This allows us to hope that one day humanity will no longer be in danger of disappearing completely.</p>
<p>But we are not sure that humankind can ever stabilize itself in abundance. The chain has always continued, but we must not upset the equilibrium of the immense body in which we are a parasite because, by developing too much, we could trigger a catastrophe, which at best might bring about a recession and at worst cause complete destruction.</p>
<p>In a healthy body, a few germs can live without danger, but if they develop too much, they cause a disease, which troubles the organism. Then the organism reacts to destroy the germs responsible, either naturally or with the help of medication. The important thing, apparently, is to create enough worlds so that humanity does not extinguish itself, but above all else, to make sure that the equilibrium is not broken by concentrating our efforts anew on seeking to make those who exist happier.</p>
<p>It is in this area that we can help you tremendously.'</p>
<h2 id="evolution-a-myth"><a class="header" href="#evolution-a-myth">Evolution: A Myth</a></h2>
<p>'I make a parenthesis here, because you must dispel from your minds all uncertainty about evolution. Your scientists who have elaborated theories of evolution are not completely wrong in saying that humanity is descended from the monkey, and the monkey from the fish, and so on. In reality, the first living organism created on Earth was unicellular, which then gave rise to more complex life forms.</p>
<p>But this did not happen by chance! When we came to Earth to create life, we started by making very simple creations and then improved our techniques of environmental adaptation. This enabled us to make in turn fish, amphibians, mammals, birds, primates and finally man himself, who is just an improved model of the monkey to which we added what makes us essentially human.</p>
<p>In this way, we made human beings in our image, as it is written in the Bible in <em>Genesis</em>. You could have realized for yourselves that there is little chance of a series of accidents producing such a large variety of life forms - the colors of birds and their elaborate mating rituals, or the shape of certain antelope horns.</p>
<p>What natural need could lead antelopes or wild goats to develop curled horns? Or birds to have blue or red feathers? And what about exotic fish?</p>
<p>All that is the work of our artists. Do not forget the artists when you yourselves create life. Imagine a world without them - no music, films, paintings or sculptures... Life would be very boring, and animals very ugly if their bodies corresponded only to their needs and functions.</p>
<p>Evolution of the various forms of life on Earth is really the evolution of techniques of creation and the increased sophistication of the creators' work. This eventually led them to create people similar to themselves. You can find the skulls of prehistoric men who were the first human prototypes.</p>
<p>These were replaced each time by others more evolved. This continued right up to your present form, which is the exact replica of your creators who were afraid to create anything highly superior to themselves, although some were tempted to do so.</p>
<p>If we could be sure that human beings would never turn against their creators to dominate or destroy them - as has happened between the ifferent human races created successively on Earth - but instead would love them as parents, the temptation would be great to create an improved humankind.</p>
<p>This is possible but at what enormous risk! In fact, some creators worry that the people of the Earth may be slightly superior to their fathers. &quot;Satan&quot; is one of those who has always thought, and still does, that the people of the Earth are a danger to our planet because they are a little too intelligent. But the majority among us thinks that you will prove to us that you love us, and that you will never try to destroy us. That is the least we expect before coming to help you.</p>
<p>It is even possible that at each creation of humankind by humankind, a small improvement is achieved, a true evolution of the human race, which is gradual, so that the creators do not feel threatened when faced with their creations.</p>
<p>This makes it possible to speed up progress. Although we do not think that at present we can give you our scientific heritage, we do feel it is safe to give you our political and humanitarian knowledge.</p>
<p>This will not threaten your planet, but will allow you to be happier on Earth. Thanks to this happiness, you will progress faster, and that could also help you to show us more speedily that you deserve our help and our inheritance in striving to achieve an intergalactic level of civilization.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if humanity cannot calm its aggressiveness, if peace does not become your only goal, and you allow people to promote war, produce arms, test nuclear weapons, and maintain armies just to seize or retain power, then we will stop such people from becoming a danger to us, and there would be another Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>
<p>How could we not fear people from Earth when they attack their own, we who are from another world and slightly different?</p>
<p>You, Claude Vorilhon, you will spread the truth under your present name, which you will replace progressively with RAEL, which means literally &quot;light of God&quot; and if we translate it more accurately, &quot;light of the Elohim&quot; or &quot;Ambassador of the Elohim&quot;, because you will be our ambassador on Earth, and we will come only officially to your Embassy. RAEL can be simply translated as &quot;messenger&quot;.</p>
<p>And it is through telepathy that we made you name your son Ramuel, which means &quot;the son of the one who brings light&quot;, because he is
truly the son of our messenger, of our ambassador.'</p>
<p>And following that pronouncement, he left, just as he had done on other mornings.</p>

<h2 id="geniocracy"><a class="header" href="#geniocracy">Geniocracy</a></h2>
<p>I met him the next day, and again he began to speak:</p>
<p>'First of all, let us look at the political and economic aspects of life.</p>
<p>What kind of people allows humanity to progress? The geniuses.</p>
<p>Therefore, your world must revalorize its geniuses and allow them to govern the Earth.</p>
<p>Power was in the hands of brutes, who were superior to others because of their muscular strength. Next in power were the rich, who used their money to employ many &quot;brutes&quot; in their service. Then came the politicians who ensnared the people of democratic countries with their own hopes â€” not to mention military men whose success has been based around the rational organization of brutality.</p>
<p>The only type of people you have never placed in power are the ones who help humanity to progress. Whether they discovered the wheel, gunpowder, the internal combustion engine or the atom, the geniuses have always allowed less intelligent people in power to benefit from their inventions. Often such people have used peaceful inventions for murderous ends. All that must be changed.</p>
<p>For this to happen, you must abolish all your electoral and polling systems because in their present form, they are completely unsuited to human development. Each person is a useful cell in this huge body we call humanity. The cell in your foot should not decide whether or not your hand should pick up a given object. It is the brain, which must decide, and if the object in question is good, the cell of your foot will benefit from it. It is not up to the foot to vote. Its job is simply to transport the body -including the brain- and it is not
capable of judging if what the hand takes is good or not.</p>
<p>Votes only have a positive effect when there is an equivalence of knowledge and intellect. Copernicus was condemned by a majority of incompetent people because he was the only one at that time who had a sufficiently high level of comprehension. Although the Church -that is t  say the majority- believed the Earth was the center of the universe, this turned out to be wrong. The Earth really revolved around the sun, and Copernicus -the minority- turned out to be right.</p>
<p>When the first cars were invented, if we had asked everyone to vote to establish whether cars should be allowed to exist or not, the majority, who knew nothing about cars and did not care, would have responded negatively, and you would still be riding in a horse and cart. So, how can you change all that?</p>
<p>These days, you have psychologists who are capable of creating tests to evaluate the intelligence and adaptation of every individual.</p>
<p>These tests should be applied systematically from infancy onward in order to define each individual's orientation towards subjects studied.</p>
<p>When individuals reach a responsible age, their intellectual coefficient can be measured and included on their identity or voter's card. Only those with an intellectual capacity of at least fifty per cent above the average should be eligible for a public post. To vote, individuals would need an intellectual coefficient of at least ten per cent above average. If such a system existed now, many of your present politicians would not hold the positions they do today.</p>
<p>This is a totally democratic system. There are many engineers, for example, who are of lower than average intelligence, but who have very good memories and have obtained several academic degrees because of this.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are many laborers or farm workers who have no specialized education at all, but whose intelligence is fifty per cent above the average. What is totally unacceptable now is that the voice of someone whom you might vulgarly call &quot;a cretin&quot; is worth as much as that of a genius, who has thought maturely about the way he or she is going to vote. In some small cities, elections are won by the candidate who buys people the most drinks â€” not by the individual whose policies are the most interesting.</p>
<p>Therefore, right from the start, the right to vote should be reserved for those people whose brains are more suited to thinking and finding solutions to problems - that is to say, an elite group of high intelligence. This does not necessarily mean those people who have done the most studying.</p>
<p>We are talking about placing the genius in power, and you may call that &quot;Geniocracy&quot;.'</p>
<h2 id="humanitarianism"><a class="header" href="#humanitarianism">Humanitarianism</a></h2>
<p>'Second point: Your world is paralyzed by profit, and Communism fails to provide a carrot big enough to motivate people and encourage them to make progress.</p>
<p>You are all born equal; this is also written in the Bible. Your governments should ensure that people are born with approximately the same level of financial means. It is unacceptable that children of low intelligence should live in luxury thanks to the fortunes amassed by their fathers, while geniuses die of hunger and do any menial chore just to eat.</p>
<p>This way they forsake occupations where they could have made discoveries benefiting the whole of humanity. To avoid this, property ownership must be abolished without establishing Communism.</p>
<p>This world is not yours - that also is written in the Bible. You are only tenants. Thus all goods should be rented for forty-nine years.</p>
<p>This will eliminate the injustice of inheritance. Your true inheritance, and that of your children, is the entire world, if you knew how to organize yourselves to make it pleasant. This political orientation of humanity is not Communism; its preoccupation is the future of humanity. If you want to give it a name, call it &quot;Humanitarianism&quot;.</p>
<p>Take for example a man who has finished his studies at the age of twenty-one and wants to work. He chooses his profession and earns a salary. If he wants to find a place to live while his parents are still alive, he &quot;buys&quot; a house - but of course, in reality, he is renting a house or apartment for forty-nine years from the State which constructed it.</p>
<p>If the value of the house is estimated at 100,000 francs, he can pay that amount divided into monthly installments for forty-nine years.</p>
<p>At the age of seventy (twenty-one plus forty-nine), he will have paid for his house and can live there until his death, without ever paying again.</p>
<p>After his death, the house will go back to the State, which must then allow his children, if there are any, to benefit from it freely.</p>
<p>Supposing there is one child, then this child can live freely all his life in his father's house. At his death, his child in turn can also benefit from the family house, and so on indefinitely. Inheritance must be completely abolished, except for the family house. This does not, however, prevent each person from being rewarded individually for their merits.</p>
<p>Let us take another example. Someone has two children. One is a good worker, and the other is lazy. At the age of twenty-one, they both decide to go their own separate ways. They each rent a house worth 100,000 francs.</p>
<p>The worker will rapidly earn more money than the lazy one. He will then be able to rent a house worth twice as much as the first one.</p>
<p>If he has the means, he will even be able to rent both houses, one as a country house.</p>
<p>If his savings are fruitful, he will also be able to build a house and rent it for forty-nine years, thereby receiving money due to him. But at his death, everything will go back to the community, except for the family home, which will go to the children.</p>
<p>Thus individuals can make a fortune for themselves depending on their own merits, but not for their children. To each their own merits.</p>
<p>The same should apply to commercial and industrial enterprises. If someone creates a business, it is theirs for their entire life, and they can rent it out, but never for more than forty-nine years. The same goes for farmers. They can rent land and cultivate it for forty-nine years, but after that, it all goes back to the State, which will be able to rent it out again for another forty-nine years. Their children can also rent it for forty-nine years.</p>
<p>This method must be adopted for all goods that remain exploitable, and as for the value of things, nothing changes. Everything that is of value such as shares, gold, enterprises, cash, or buildings is owned by the community but may be rented for forty-nine years by those who have acquired the means by their own merits and labor.</p>
<p>In this way, somebody who made a fortune around the age of forty will be able to construct houses, rent them as apartments for forty-nine years, and enjoy that money so long as life lasts.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the money, which comes from these rents, will go back to the community. This humanitarianism is already prescribed in the Bible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.</p>
<p><em>â€” Leviticus 25: 8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another: According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee: According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.</p>
<p><em>â€” Leviticus 25: 14-16.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.</p>
<p><em>â€” Leviticus 25: 23.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If geniuses are admitted to power, they will understand the usefulness of these reforms. You must also see to it that all the nations of the Earth unite to form only one government.'</p>
<h2 id="world-government"><a class="header" href="#world-government">World Government</a></h2>
<p>'The creation of a new worldwide currency and a common language would help you to establish a world government. The Auvergne dialect is no longer spoken in Clermont-Ferrand, and very soon, French will no longer be spoken in Paris, nor English in London, nor German in Frankfurt. Your scientists and linguists should unite and create a new language, inspired by all languages and made obligatory in all the schools of the world, as a second language.</p>
<p>The same must be done with money. Worldwide currency values cannot be based on the franc, the dollar, or the yen, but must be based on a new currency created for the needs of the whole Earth, without depriving one group of people who would ask themselves why another currency has been chosen instead of their own.</p>
<p>Finally, the trigger required to bring about such a union is the suppression of military conscription, which teaches only aggressiveness to young men. Professional armies must then be put at the service of the public.</p>
<p>This must happen at the same time in all countries so as to provide an indispensable guarantee of security.'</p>
<h2 id="your-mission"><a class="header" href="#your-mission">Your Mission</a></h2>
<p>'As I have already told you, we know that our official arrival would accelerate many things. But we will wait until we see that human beings really want us to come, that they love us and respect us like the parents that we truly are, and that our spacecrafts will not be
threatened by your destructive military forces.</p>
<p>To achieve this, make it known throughout the world that you have met me, and repeat what I have said to you. Wise people will listen to you. Many will take you for a madman or a visionary, but I have already explained to you what to think of the imbecilic majority.</p>
<p>You know the truth, and we will stay in contact with you by telepathy to give you confidence and additional information if we think it is necessary.</p>
<p>What we want is to see if there are enough wise people on Earth. If a sufficiently large number of people follow you, then we will come openly. Where? At the place you will have prepared for our arrival.</p>
<p>Have a residence built in a pleasant country with a mild climate, with seven rooms always ready to receive guests, each with a separate bathroom, a conference room able to accommodate twenty-one people, a swimming pool and a dining room capable of seating twenty-one people.</p>
<p>This residence should be constructed in the middle of a park and should be protected from curious onlookers. The park should be entirely surrounded by walls to prevent anyone from seeing the residence and the swimming pool.</p>
<p>The residence should be situated at a distance of at least one thousand meters from the walls around the park. It will have a maximum of two stories and should be further screened from view by an inner barrier of trees and bushes. Install two entrances in the surrounding wall, one to the south and another on the northern side.</p>
<p>The residence will also have two entrances. There will be a terrace on the roof where a spacecraft of twelve meters in diameter may land. Access from that terrace to the interior is essential.</p>
<p>The air space above and around the residence should not be under direct military or radar surveillance.</p>
<p>You will try to ensure that the area where this residence is built -if possible larger than stipulated here- is treated as neutral territory by other nations and by the nation on whose territory it is located, by virtue of it being our embassy on Earth.</p>
<p>You may live with your wife and children in the residence, which will be under your direction, and you will be able to have servants there and invite guests of your choosing. However, the area containing the seven rooms should be directly under the terrace, and it should be separated from the section used by human beings by a thick metal door, lockable from the inside, which is kept permanently closed. An aseptic chamber should be built at the entrance to the conference room.</p>
<p>The financing of the project will be made possible through the help you will receive from those people who will believe in you, and therefore in us. They will be wise and intelligent, and they will be rewarded when we come.</p>
<p>Keep a record, therefore, of those who contribute financially to the construction and upkeep of the residence, however modest their contribution.</p>
<p>Also, in each nation throughout the world, appoint an individual who will be responsible for communicating the truth, and who will help others join together to spread it.</p>
<p>Once a year, on a mountain near the residence, gather together from all over the world all those people who have heard about us through these writings and want us to come. Assemble the largest number of people possible, and have them think intensely about us and hope for our
coming.</p>
<p>When there are enough people, and when they wish intensely enough for us to come without any religious mysticism, but as responsible people respecting their creators, then we will land openly and give you our scientific knowledge as our heritage to all peoples of the Earth.</p>
<p>If those with warlike temperaments are rendered harmless all over the whole world, then this will happen. If the love of life and humanity's love for us and itself are strong enough, yes, we will come openly.</p>
<p>We will wait, and if human beings remain aggressive and continue to progress in a manner which is dangerous for other worlds, then we will destroy this civilization and its repositories of scientific wealth, and there will be another Sodom and Gomorrah, until such time as humanity becomes morally worthy of its level of scientific understanding.</p>
<p>The future of humanity is in its own hands, and the truth is in yours. Communicate it throughout the world and do not be discouraged.</p>
<p>We will never help you openly, or in any way that would give proof to the skeptics, since skepticism often goes hand in hand with aggressiveness. Intelligent people will believe you since what you will say contains nothing mystical.</p>
<p>It is important to us that they believe you without any material proof. This proves to us more than anything else that they are intelligent and so are worthy to receive our scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>Now go. You will not be forgotten if you succeed during your life on Earth â€” or even after. If necessary, we can wait until the time of your descendants to make our landing, because we can make you live again scientifically, just as we can resurrect all those who have led humanity along the path of human genius guided by the love of their creators â€” so long as their remains are preserved in coffins or tombs.</p>
<p>The only help we will give you will be to appear in the skies more and more frequently from now on in order to make people aware of the problems, and make them want to learn more about the truth that you are transmitting.</p>
<p>Gradually, thanks to these increased sightings, public awareness will also increase, and our presence will no longer trigger stupid adoration, but instead a deep desire within the population to make contact with us.</p>
<p>You will call your movement <em>Madech</em> â€” the &quot;movement for welcoming the Elohim, creators of humanity&quot;, which carries in its initials a message, <em>Moise a devancÃ© Elie et le Christ,</em> which means: Moses preceded Elijah and the Christ.</p>
<p>In French this is:</p>
<ul>
<li>M: mouvement pour (movement for)</li>
<li>A: l'accueil (the welcoming)</li>
<li>D: des (of the)</li>
<li>E: Elohim</li>
<li>C: crÃ©ateurs de (creators of)</li>
<li>H: l'humanitÃ© (humanity).'</li>

<p>'Before we leave each other for the last time,' he said, 'do you have any questions to ask me?'</p>
<p>'You have interpreted the vision of Ezekiel as people equipped with space suits,' I replied, 'and you told me that the atmosphere of your planet was not the same as that on Earth. So why aren't you wearing a pressurized suit now?'</p>
<p>'Because we too have progressed scientifically, and now we can do without them. My face seems to be in the open air, but really it is protected by an invisible shield composed of repellent rays inside which I breathe different air from you. These rays let waves pass through, but not air molecules. It's a bit like the way you prevent fuel deposits escaping from certain ports in your technology by using emissions of bubbles.'</p>
<p>'Are nuclear weapons a danger for humanity?'</p>
<p>'Yes, a great danger. But if humanity does not become wise and peaceful, the existence of your nuclear weapons will mean that if the need arises, we will not have much to do in bringing about the destruction of your civilization. Perhaps you might even destroy yourselves.'</p>
<p>'If you do not, however, and if you become a threat to us, we will only have to destroy your stocks of bombs without sending offensive weapons against you. We could do this with either rays, or telepathy, in such a way that, in effect, one of the great powers would become the aggressor, and this would automatically release a fatal retaliation.'</p>
<p>'If people do not want to be exposed to that danger any longer, all they have to do is take nuclear weapons away from the military. Such nuclear power used with care could enable countries that lack energy to make great strides forward. You urgently need to stop nuclear weapons testing because you know nothing of the risks to which you are exposing yourselves. However, if humanity continues to play with nuclear weapons, it will simplify our task if we have to reduce you to silence.'</p>
<p>'Do you have any women on your planet?'</p>
<p>'Yes, it is mentioned in the Bible, and I made you note the appropriate quotation.'</p>
<p>'And children also?'</p>
<p>'Yes, we can have children exactly like you.'</p>
<h2 id="overpopulation"><a class="header" href="#overpopulation">Overpopulation</a></h2>
<p>'You told me you were immortal in some way. How do you prevent over population?'</p>
<p>'This problem will, in fact, be making itself evident very rapidly on Earth. To resolve it -and you should resolve it immediately because you are already sufficiently numerous- you must develop contraception and pass strict laws authorizing women to have no more than two children.</p>
<p>If a couple has only two children, the population will arrive at a point where it no longer increases. We will be watching how well you deal with this too. It will be another test of your intelligence, which will help us see if you have earned our heritage. This solution I offer is for humanity now where people only live for seventy-five years on average. For us, the problem is very different. We are not eternal, but we are able to live ten times longer than you, thanks to a small surgical adjustment, which in effect is the biblical &quot;tree of life&quot;. We have children, and we observe the rules, which I have just explained: two parents, two children. This keeps our population constant.'</p>
<p>'How many of you are there?'</p>
<p>'We are a population of about seven billion.'</p>
<p>'We have met on six consecutive days, but did you always go back each time to your own planet?'</p>
<p>'No, I returned to an intergalactic ship, which we use as a base and which stays constantly close to the Earth.'</p>
<p>'How many of you are on that vessel?'</p>
<p>'Seven, and on our planet there are seven provinces. Each has a representative on that vessel. If we add the two who are responsible for the vessel, there are permanently nine of us.'</p>
<p>'If the people here on Earth do exactly as you wish, what will happen?'</p>
<p>'We will come officially and land at the residence, which you will have prepared. We will ask you to invite there the official representatives of the most important countries of humanity, in order to bring about total unification of the people on the Earth. If all goes well, we will allow humanity to benefit step by step from our scientific advances. Depending on the uses that will be made of it, we will see if we can give humanity all our knowledge and allow you to enter the intergalactic era with our 25,000 years of scientific progress as your inheritance.'</p>
<p>'Are you the only world to have attained such an advanced level in science?'</p>
<p>'In this region of the universe, yes. There is an infinite number of worlds inhabited by beings of the humanoid type whose scientific level is lower than ours, although much superior to yours. What makes us fearful of disappearing is the fact that we have not yet found any planet with a civilization as highly evolved as our own. We have economic relations with many other planets on which life has been created by other people who must have reached a scientific level equivalent to ours, because their religious writings prove this to us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we have been unable to find the civilizations who created the closest of these worlds. But perhaps we will find them farther on as we continue to search the universe, each time moving further away. In most cases, their planets approached the sun too closely, and life became impossible, or their sun exploded, or became too cold. Although we have not noticed anything abnormal at present in our system, all this makes us fear the worst.'</p>
<p>'So there is no religion where you live?'</p>
<p>'Our only religion is human genius. We believe only in that, and we particularly love the memory of our own creators whom we never saw again and whose world we have never been able to find. They must have disappeared. However, they had taken the precaution of putting a huge space station in orbit around our planet, containing all their knowledge, and this landed automatically when their world was destroyed. Thanks to them, we have taken on the torch, and we would like to see this torch taken up by the people of the Earth.'</p>
<p>'And what would happen if your planet was destroyed?'</p>
<p>'In case our world is destroyed, the same arrangements have been made in advance, so that you would automatically inherit all our knowledge.'</p>
<h2 id="the-secret-of-eternity"><a class="header" href="#the-secret-of-eternity">The Secret of Eternity</a></h2>
<p>'Do you really live ten times longer than we do?' I asked.</p>
<p>'Our body lives on average, ten times longer than yours,' he replied.</p>
<p>'Like the first people of the Bible, that is between 750 and 1,200 years. But our mind, our true self, can be truly immortal. I have already explained to you that, starting with any cell of the body, we can re-create the whole person with new living matter. When we are in full possession of our faculties and our brain is at its maximum level of efficiency and knowledge, we surgically remove a tiny sample 108 of the body, which we then preserve. Then, when we really die, we take a cell from this preserved sample and re-create the body in full, just as it had been at the time the sample was taken.</p>
<p>I say, &quot;as it had been at that time&quot;, meaning with all its scientific knowledge and, of course, its personality. But in this case, the body is made up of new elements with the potential for another one thousand years of life - and so on eternally. But in order to limit the
growth of the population, only geniuses have the right to eternity.</p>
<p>Everybody on our planet has a cell sample taken at a certain age, hoping that they will be chosen for re-creation after their death. In fact they not only hope for it, they try to earn this resurrection during their life. Once they have died, a grand council of the eternals assembles to decide in a &quot;last judgement&quot;, who among those who died during the year deserves to live another life. For a period of three lifetimes, the eternal is on probation, and at the end of this time, the council of the eternals reconvenes to judge who, in the light of their work, deserves to join the council of the eternals as a perpetual member.</p>
<p>From the moment that one wishes to have a new life, one no longer has the right to have children, although this does not of course prevent love. This explains why the scientists who were members of the council of the eternals wished to create life on other planets. They transferred their procreative instincts onto other planets.'</p>
<p>'What do you call yourselves?'</p>
<p>'If you wish to give us a name, even though we call ourselves men and women in our language, you may call us Elohim, since we did indeed come from the sky.'</p>
<p>'What language do you speak on your planet?'</p>
<p>'Our official language closely resembles ancient Hebrew.'</p>
<p>'Each day we have talked here, weren't you afraid other people might have surprised us?'</p>
<p>'An automatic system would have warned me immediately if people had approached within a dangerous radius, by air or by land.'</p>
<p>'What is your lifestyle and your work where you live?'</p>
<p>'Most of our work is intellectual, as our level of scientific development allows us to use robots for everything. We work only when we feel the inclination â€” and then only with our brain. Only our artists and our sports people work with their bodies and only because they have chosen this.</p>
<p>'Our highly developed atomic energy is almost inexhaustible, especially since we have discovered a way to use the atom in a closed circuit and solar energy. We also have many other sources of energy. We do not necessarily use uranium in our atomic reactors, but several other simple and harmless materials.'</p>
<p>'But if you live so long, and do not work, do you not get bored?'</p>
<p>'No, never, because we always do things we enjoy doing - especially making love. We find our women very beautiful, and we make the most of this.'</p>
<p>'Does marriage exist?'</p>
<p>'No. Men and women are both free. Couples exist. Those who have chosen to live as such may do so, but they may have their freedom back whenever they wish. We all love one another. Jealousy does not exist, since everyone can have everything, and property is non-existent. There is no criminality where we live, thus no prisons and no police. However, there are many doctors and regular medical visits for the mind.</p>
<p>Those who show the slightest sign of psychological imbalance that could threaten the life or liberty of others are immediately given treatment in order to bring them back to normal.'</p>
<p>'Can you describe the day of an average individual where you live?'</p>
<p>'In the morning, they would get up and bathe, since there are swimming pools everywhere, have breakfast and then do whatever they feel like doing. Everybody &quot;works&quot;, but only because they feel like working, as there is no money where we live. Thus those who work always do it well, since it is by vocation.</p>
<p>Only the eternals have specific tasks, for example supervising the electronic brains and computers used for dealing with vital functions such as energy, food and organization. Of the seven billion inhabitants, there are only 700 eternals, and they live entirely apart from the others. They have the privilege of being eternals but with this goes the duty of doing everything for the others who are not obliged to work.</p>
<p>To these 700 eternals, we must add 210 probationers (about seventy each year, that is to say, ten from each province). Of the seven billion inhabitants, there are only about forty million children. It is only when they become of age - between eighteen and twenty-one years, depending on the individual - that the children undergo the operation, which gives them a life span of more than 750 years. From then on, they too may have children. This enables the oldest of our non-eternal inhabitants to know their descendants for up to fifty generations.</p>
<p>Out of seven billion inhabitants, there are only about one million inactive people, and almost all of them are under treatment for psychological disorders. Our doctors treat them for a period of six months. Most people are interested in the arts, and they paint, sculpt, play music, write, produce films and participate in sports etc... We have a leisure civilization in the full sense of the word.</p>
<p>Our cities have an average population of about 500,000 people spread over a very small area. A city is in fact a huge house situated in a high place, inside which people can sleep, love, and do whatever they please.</p>
<p>These city houses are about one kilometer in length and height and are traversed in all directions by waves used by everyone for travelling.</p>
<p>You tie on a belt, and then place yourself in a wave current, which transports you very rapidly to wherever you wish to go.</p>
<p>The cities are cube-like in shape, so that they do not eat up the countryside as they do where you live. Indeed one of your cities with say a population of about 500,000 covers a surface area twenty times greater than ours. The result is that when you want to go into the country, you have to travel for many hours, whereas in our case, we are there in only tens of seconds. The same architect conceives an entire city, so that it will be pleasing to the eye and will harmonize perfectly with the scenery surrounding it.'</p>
<p>'But don't the people who have nothing to do get bored?'</p>
<p>'No, because we provide them with numerous activities. The individual's true value is recognized, and everyone wants to show that they have worth.</p>
<p>Whether it be in art, in science or in sports, each person wants to shine in order to become eternal, or simply to be admired by the community - or by a woman. Some people like to take risks, and to deprive them of the risk of dying would take away their joy of living, and that is why dangerous sports are very popular.</p>
<p>We can bring back to life any injured person, but those who practice these sports may do so only if they state in writing that they agree not to be taken care of if they die during their sporting activities. We have a kind of atomic automobile race that would fascinate you and more violent activities like boxing, and even more violent than that, a kind of rugby game, which is played in the nude and where everything is permitted - boxing, wrestling and so on. All this may seem barbaric to you, but do not forget that all extremes must be balanced to avoid breakdowns.</p>
<p>An extremely sophisticated civilization must have primitive counterbalances. If our people did not have their idols in their favorite sport, they would have only one wish left, to die. The life of another individual must be respected, but their wish to die, or to play with death, must also be respected and permitted within well structured and well defined specialties.</p>
<p>Where we live, contests are held each year in all branches of the various activities, one of which is a worldwide contest, permitting us to decide on the best individuals who deserve eternal life. Everyone lives only for that.</p>
<p>Each year, whether it be painting, literature, biology, medicine, or any other specialty where the human brain can express itself, a competition takes place in every province, with a vote from the eternals of that province; the &quot;champions&quot; are gathered in the capital to submit themselves to the vote of a jury of eternals who designate those who become &quot;champions among champions&quot;.</p>
<p>These people are then presented to the Grand Council of eternals, who finally choose those who are worthy of becoming eternal probationers. This is the goal and everybody's ideal. Distractions may well take on a primitive aspect when the supreme goal is so high.'</p>
<p>'Does this mean that the eternals have a totally different way of life from the other inhabitants?'</p>
<p>'Oh yes. They live apart in cities reserved for them and meet regularly to make decisions.'</p>
<p>'How old are the oldest ones?'</p>
<p>'The oldest, the president of the council of the eternals, is 25,000 years old, and you see him before you now. I have lived in twenty-five bodies up to this day, and I was the first one on whom this experiment was successfully carried out. That is why I am the president of the eternals. I myself directed the creation of life on Earth.'</p>
<p>'Then your knowledge must be immeasurable?'</p>
<p>'Yes, I have accumulated quite a lot of knowledge, and I will not be able to gain much more. It is in this way that the people on Earth may be superior to us because the capacity of that part of the brain, which accumulates information, the memory, is larger. Human beings on Earth will be able to accumulate more knowledge than us, and therefore will advance further scientifically, if they have the means. This is what frightens those who oppose the council of eternals. People on Earth may progress faster than us, if nothing stops them.'</p>
<h2 id="chemical-education"><a class="header" href="#chemical-education">Chemical Education</a></h2>
<p>'The knowledge that students need to accumulate must be enormous, and must take a very long time?'</p>
<p>'No. Thanks to an important scientific discovery, which in fact your scientists on Earth are beginning to consider, we can teach a student his lessons surgically. Your scientists have just discovered that if you inject the liquid from the memory of an educated rat into the brain of an uneducated rat, it will learn what the other knew.</p>
<p>We can transmit information by the injection of brain memory matter, thus our children have almost no work to do. They regularly undergo injections of brain matter taken from people possessing the information necessary for instruction. Therefore, children only spend their time doing interesting things, which they decide on themselves, such as rebuilding the world in theory and fulfilling themselves in sports and the arts.'</p>
<p>'You never have wars among the provinces of your world?'</p>
<p>'Never. The sports competitions are sufficiently developed to eliminate the war instinct. Besides, psychologically, the fact that young people are able to risk their lives in games where systematically there are many deaths during each event suppresses the war instinct.</p>
<p>This enables those who feel this instinct too intensely to satiate it at the peril of their own life, without involving those who do not want to travel along such perilous paths. If on Earth sports and games were more dangerous but organized, it would greatly reduce the chances of creating international conflicts.'</p>
<p>'Are the seven provinces of your world similar?'</p>
<p>'No, as on Earth there are different races and cultures. Our provinces were created and based on those races and cultures, while respecting the freedom and independence of each one.'</p>
<p>'Would it be possible for a man from Earth to visit your planet?'</p>
<p>'Yes, but you would have to wear a space suit adapted for your breathing. You could live without such a suit in a special residence where we have reproduced the Earth's atmosphere. There, many people from Earth live, including Moses, Elijah and Jesus Christ along with many other living testimonies of our creation. We will be able to bring all these people back to Earth when the time comes to support your statements.'</p>
<p>'Why not bring them back at once?'</p>
<p>'Because in your incredulous world, if Jesus Christ returned, he would be placed in a psychiatric institution. Imagine someone landing among you saying he is the Christ. He would certainly be mocked and quickly locked up. If we intervened by performing scientific wonders to show he really was the Christ, that would bring back religions based on God. It would also lend support to the idea of the supernatural or the mystical, and we do not want either.'</p>
<p>Having said that, the small man saluted me for the last time and told me that he would return only when all that he had asked of me was accomplished. Then he climbed back aboard his machine, and it took off and disappeared just as it had on other mornings.</p>
<h2 id="the-raelian-movement"><a class="header" href="#the-raelian-movement">The Raelian Movement</a></h2>
<p>What a story! What a revelation!</p>
<p>After returning home and classifying and copying up the notes I had taken, I realized the immensity of the task that had been entrusted to me.</p>
<p>I felt I had little chance of carrying it out. But since it is not necessary to hope in order to embark on an undertaking, I decided to do exactly what was asked of me, even though I might be taken for a visionary. After all, if being a visionary means having received the light, then I am quite willing to be considered a visionary. It is better to be called a visionary and know the truth, than to be called enlightened and not know the truth.</p>
<p>I wish to emphasize to skeptics of all kinds that I never drink alcohol and sleep very well at night. One can neither dream for six consecutive days, nor invent all this.</p>
<p>To you who refuse to believe me, I say: Watch the sky, and you will see more and more sights that neither our scientists nor the military will be able to explain - except by foolish babblings aimed at saving reputations which they believe they would lose if the truth did not originate from someone in their closed circle. How could a scientist possibly not know?</p>
<p>Those who condemned Copernicus - because he dared to say the Earth was not the center of the universe - could never admit that someone other than themselves could reveal all that.</p>
<p>But all of you who have seen or will see unidentified flying objects, which some people will explain away as dreams, or weather balloons, or even hallucinations, and all of you who dare not talk about it for fear of being mocked, it is only by getting together with those who believe that you will be able to speak freely.</p>
<p>All these revelations brought me such a sense of well-being and such an inner peacefulness in this world where we do not know what to believe, where we cannot believe in a white bearded God or in a hoofed devil, and where official scientists cannot give precise explanations of our origins and our goals.</p>
<p>In the light of these amazing revelations, everything becomes so clear and seems so simple. Knowing that somewhere in the universe, there is a planet full of people who created us similar to themselves, who love us, all the while fearing that their creations might surpass them â€” is this not profoundly moving? Especially if one thinks that we will, in turn, be able to participate in the evolution of this Humanity, of which we are a part, like them, by creating life on other worlds.</p>
<p>Now that you have read this book that I have written, in which I have tried to set out as clearly as possible all that was said to me, if you simply think that I have a great imagination and that these writings were produced just to amuse you, then I will be profoundly disappointed.</p>
<p>But perhaps, on the other hand, these revelations will give you confidence in the future and allow you to understand the mystery of creation and the destiny of humanity. Perhaps they will answer the many questions that you have asked yourselves at night ever since your childhood, wondering why we exist and what our purpose is on this Earth. If this happens, I shall be very happy indeed.</p>
<p>Finally, if you understand that all I have said here is the profound truth and wish, as I do, to see these people land here officially very soon to give us their heritage, and if you want to play a part in realizing all that was asked of me, then I will have fulfilled my mission in writing this book.</p>
<p>If this is the case, write to me, and we will welcome you into the Raelian Movement. We will build the residence that they desire, and when we are numerous enough all over the world to wait for them with the respect and love that those who created us would have the right to demand, then they will come, and we will become the beneficiaries of their immense knowledge.</p>
<p>To all of you who believe in God or in Jesus Christ, I say you were right in such a belief. Even if you thought all was not exactly as the Church would have you believe, there was a foundation of truth. You were right to believe in the basis of the scriptures, but wrong to sustain the Church. If you continue to distribute your money to provide cardinals with the finest vestments, and at your expense continue to authorize the existence of the military and their nuclear threat, then it means that you wish to remain primitive and are not interested in entering the golden age to which we are now entitled.</p>
<p>If, however, you wish to participate passively or actively, according to your means, in the creation and development of the Raelian Movement, take your pen and write to me. We will very soon be numerous enough to choose a piece of land on which the embassy will be built. If you still have doubts, read the papers and look at the sky. You will see that sightings of mysterious crafts are becoming more and more numerous, and this will give you the courage to send your letter to me, addressed to:</p>
