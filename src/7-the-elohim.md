## Nuclear Weapons

'Before we leave each other for the last time,' he said, 'do you have any questions to ask me?'

'You have interpreted the vision of Ezekiel as people equipped with space suits,' I replied, 'and you told me that the atmosphere of your planet was not the same as that on Earth. So why aren't you wearing a pressurized suit now?'

'Because we too have progressed scientifically, and now we can do without them. My face seems to be in the open air, but really it is protected by an invisible shield composed of repellent rays inside which I breathe different air from you. These rays let waves pass through, but not air molecules. It\'s a bit like the way you prevent fuel deposits escaping from certain ports in your technology by using emissions of bubbles.'

'Are nuclear weapons a danger for humanity?'

'Yes, a great danger. But if humanity does not become wise and peaceful, the existence of your nuclear weapons will mean that if the need arises, we will not have much to do in bringing about the destruction of your civilization. Perhaps you might even destroy yourselves.'

'If you do not, however, and if you become a threat to us, we will only have to destroy your stocks of bombs without sending offensive weapons against you. We could do this with either rays, or telepathy, in such a way that, in effect, one of the great powers would become the aggressor, and this would automatically release a fatal retaliation.'

'If people do not want to be exposed to that danger any longer, all they have to do is take nuclear weapons away from the military. Such nuclear power used with care could enable countries that lack energy to make great strides forward. You urgently need to stop nuclear weapons testing because you know nothing of the risks to which you are exposing yourselves. However, if humanity continues to play with nuclear weapons, it will simplify our task if we have to reduce you to silence.'

'Do you have any women on your planet?'

'Yes, it is mentioned in the Bible, and I made you note the appropriate quotation.'

'And children also?'

'Yes, we can have children exactly like you.'


## Overpopulation

'You told me you were immortal in some way. How do you prevent over population?'

'This problem will, in fact, be making itself evident very rapidly on Earth. To resolve it -and you should resolve it immediately because you are already sufficiently numerous- you must develop contraception and pass strict laws authorizing women to have no more than two children.

If a couple has only two children, the population will arrive at a point where it no longer increases. We will be watching how well you deal with this too. It will be another test of your intelligence, which will help us see if you have earned our heritage. This solution I offer is for humanity now where people only live for seventy-five years on average. For us, the problem is very different. We are not eternal, but we are able to live ten times longer than you, thanks to a small surgical adjustment, which in effect is the biblical "tree of life". We have children, and we observe the rules, which I have just explained: two parents, two children. This keeps our population constant.'

'How many of you are there?'

'We are a population of about seven billion.'

'We have met on six consecutive days, but did you always go back each time to your own planet?'

'No, I returned to an intergalactic ship, which we use as a base and which stays constantly close to the Earth.'

'How many of you are on that vessel?'

'Seven, and on our planet there are seven provinces. Each has a representative on that vessel. If we add the two who are responsible for the vessel, there are permanently nine of us.'

'If the people here on Earth do exactly as you wish, what will happen?'

'We will come officially and land at the residence, which you will have prepared. We will ask you to invite there the official representatives of the most important countries of humanity, in order to bring about total unification of the people on the Earth. If all goes well, we will allow humanity to benefit step by step from our scientific advances. Depending on the uses that will be made of it, we will see if we can give humanity all our knowledge and allow you to enter the intergalactic era with our 25,000 years of scientific progress as your inheritance.'

'Are you the only world to have attained such an advanced level in science?'

'In this region of the universe, yes. There is an infinite number of worlds inhabited by beings of the humanoid type whose scientific level is lower than ours, although much superior to yours. What makes us fearful of disappearing is the fact that we have not yet found any planet with a civilization as highly evolved as our own. We have economic relations with many other planets on which life has been created by other people who must have reached a scientific level equivalent to ours, because their religious writings prove this to us.


Unfortunately, we have been unable to find the civilizations who created the closest of these worlds. But perhaps we will find them farther on as we continue to search the universe, each time moving further away. In most cases, their planets approached the sun too closely, and life became impossible, or their sun exploded, or became too cold. Although we have not noticed anything abnormal at present in our system, all this makes us fear the worst.'

'So there is no religion where you live?'

'Our only religion is human genius. We believe only in that, and we particularly love the memory of our own creators whom we never saw again and whose world we have never been able to find. They must have disappeared. However, they had taken the precaution of putting a huge space station in orbit around our planet, containing all their knowledge, and this landed automatically when their world was destroyed. Thanks to them, we have taken on the torch, and we would like to see this torch taken up by the people of the Earth.'

'And what would happen if your planet was destroyed?'

'In case our world is destroyed, the same arrangements have been made in advance, so that you would automatically inherit all our knowledge.'


## The Secret of Eternity

'Do you really live ten times longer than we do?' I asked.

'Our body lives on average, ten times longer than yours,' he replied.

'Like the first people of the Bible, that is between 750 and 1,200 years. But our mind, our true self, can be truly immortal. I have already explained to you that, starting with any cell of the body, we can re-create the whole person with new living matter. When we are in full possession of our faculties and our brain is at its maximum level of efficiency and knowledge, we surgically remove a tiny sample 108 of the body, which we then preserve. Then, when we really die, we take a cell from this preserved sample and re-create the body in full, just as it had been at the time the sample was taken.

I say, "as it had been at that time", meaning with all its scientific knowledge and, of course, its personality. But in this case, the body is made up of new elements with the potential for another one thousand years of life - and so on eternally. But in order to limit the
growth of the population, only geniuses have the right to eternity.

Everybody on our planet has a cell sample taken at a certain age, hoping that they will be chosen for re-creation after their death. In fact they not only hope for it, they try to earn this resurrection during their life. Once they have died, a grand council of the eternals assembles to decide in a "last judgement", who among those who died during the year deserves to live another life. For a period of three lifetimes, the eternal is on probation, and at the end of this time, the council of the eternals reconvenes to judge who, in the light of their work, deserves to join the council of the eternals as a perpetual member.

From the moment that one wishes to have a new life, one no longer has the right to have children, although this does not of course prevent love. This explains why the scientists who were members of the council of the eternals wished to create life on other planets. They transferred their procreative instincts onto other planets.'

'What do you call yourselves?'

'If you wish to give us a name, even though we call ourselves men and women in our language, you may call us Elohim, since we did indeed come from the sky.'

'What language do you speak on your planet?'

'Our official language closely resembles ancient Hebrew.'

'Each day we have talked here, weren't you afraid other people might have surprised us?'

'An automatic system would have warned me immediately if people had approached within a dangerous radius, by air or by land.'

'What is your lifestyle and your work where you live?'

'Most of our work is intellectual, as our level of scientific development allows us to use robots for everything. We work only when we feel the inclination — and then only with our brain. Only our artists and our sports people work with their bodies and only because they have chosen this.

'Our highly developed atomic energy is almost inexhaustible, especially since we have discovered a way to use the atom in a closed circuit and solar energy. We also have many other sources of energy. We do not necessarily use uranium in our atomic reactors, but several other simple and harmless materials.'

'But if you live so long, and do not work, do you not get bored?'

'No, never, because we always do things we enjoy doing - especially making love. We find our women very beautiful, and we make the most of this.'

'Does marriage exist?'

'No. Men and women are both free. Couples exist. Those who have chosen to live as such may do so, but they may have their freedom back whenever they wish. We all love one another. Jealousy does not exist, since everyone can have everything, and property is non-existent. There is no criminality where we live, thus no prisons and no police. However, there are many doctors and regular medical visits for the mind.

Those who show the slightest sign of psychological imbalance that could threaten the life or liberty of others are immediately given treatment in order to bring them back to normal.'

'Can you describe the day of an average individual where you live?'

'In the morning, they would get up and bathe, since there are swimming pools everywhere, have breakfast and then do whatever they feel like doing. Everybody "works", but only because they feel like working, as there is no money where we live. Thus those who work always do it well, since it is by vocation.

Only the eternals have specific tasks, for example supervising the electronic brains and computers used for dealing with vital functions such as energy, food and organization. Of the seven billion inhabitants, there are only 700 eternals, and they live entirely apart from the others. They have the privilege of being eternals but with this goes the duty of doing everything for the others who are not obliged to work.

To these 700 eternals, we must add 210 probationers (about seventy each year, that is to say, ten from each province). Of the seven billion inhabitants, there are only about forty million children. It is only when they become of age - between eighteen and twenty-one years, depending on the individual - that the children undergo the operation, which gives them a life span of more than 750 years. From then on, they too may have children. This enables the oldest of our non-eternal inhabitants to know their descendants for up to fifty generations.

Out of seven billion inhabitants, there are only about one million inactive people, and almost all of them are under treatment for psychological disorders. Our doctors treat them for a period of six months. Most people are interested in the arts, and they paint, sculpt, play music, write, produce films and participate in sports etc... We have a leisure civilization in the full sense of the word.

Our cities have an average population of about 500,000 people spread over a very small area. A city is in fact a huge house situated in a high place, inside which people can sleep, love, and do whatever they please.

These city houses are about one kilometer in length and height and are traversed in all directions by waves used by everyone for travelling.

You tie on a belt, and then place yourself in a wave current, which transports you very rapidly to wherever you wish to go.

The cities are cube-like in shape, so that they do not eat up the countryside as they do where you live. Indeed one of your cities with say a population of about 500,000 covers a surface area twenty times greater than ours. The result is that when you want to go into the country, you have to travel for many hours, whereas in our case, we are there in only tens of seconds. The same architect conceives an entire city, so that it will be pleasing to the eye and will harmonize perfectly with the scenery surrounding it.'

'But don't the people who have nothing to do get bored?'

'No, because we provide them with numerous activities. The individual's true value is recognized, and everyone wants to show that they have worth.

Whether it be in art, in science or in sports, each person wants to shine in order to become eternal, or simply to be admired by the community - or by a woman. Some people like to take risks, and to deprive them of the risk of dying would take away their joy of living, and that is why dangerous sports are very popular.

We can bring back to life any injured person, but those who practice these sports may do so only if they state in writing that they agree not to be taken care of if they die during their sporting activities. We have a kind of atomic automobile race that would fascinate you and more violent activities like boxing, and even more violent than that, a kind of rugby game, which is played in the nude and where everything is permitted - boxing, wrestling and so on. All this may seem barbaric to you, but do not forget that all extremes must be balanced to avoid breakdowns.

An extremely sophisticated civilization must have primitive counterbalances. If our people did not have their idols in their favorite sport, they would have only one wish left, to die. The life of another individual must be respected, but their wish to die, or to play with death, must also be respected and permitted within well structured and well defined specialties.

Where we live, contests are held each year in all branches of the various activities, one of which is a worldwide contest, permitting us to decide on the best individuals who deserve eternal life. Everyone lives only for that.

Each year, whether it be painting, literature, biology, medicine, or any other specialty where the human brain can express itself, a competition takes place in every province, with a vote from the eternals of that province; the "champions" are gathered in the capital to submit themselves to the vote of a jury of eternals who designate those who become "champions among champions".

These people are then presented to the Grand Council of eternals, who finally choose those who are worthy of becoming eternal probationers. This is the goal and everybody's ideal. Distractions may well take on a primitive aspect when the supreme goal is so high.'

'Does this mean that the eternals have a totally different way of life from the other inhabitants?'

'Oh yes. They live apart in cities reserved for them and meet regularly to make decisions.'

'How old are the oldest ones?'

'The oldest, the president of the council of the eternals, is 25,000 years old, and you see him before you now. I have lived in twenty-five bodies up to this day, and I was the first one on whom this experiment was successfully carried out. That is why I am the president of the eternals. I myself directed the creation of life on Earth.'

'Then your knowledge must be immeasurable?'

'Yes, I have accumulated quite a lot of knowledge, and I will not be able to gain much more. It is in this way that the people on Earth may be superior to us because the capacity of that part of the brain, which accumulates information, the memory, is larger. Human beings on Earth will be able to accumulate more knowledge than us, and therefore will advance further scientifically, if they have the means. This is what frightens those who oppose the council of eternals. People on Earth may progress faster than us, if nothing stops them.'


## Chemical Education

'The knowledge that students need to accumulate must be enormous, and must take a very long time?'

'No. Thanks to an important scientific discovery, which in fact your scientists on Earth are beginning to consider, we can teach a student his lessons surgically. Your scientists have just discovered that if you inject the liquid from the memory of an educated rat into the brain of an uneducated rat, it will learn what the other knew.

We can transmit information by the injection of brain memory matter, thus our children have almost no work to do. They regularly undergo injections of brain matter taken from people possessing the information necessary for instruction. Therefore, children only spend their time doing interesting things, which they decide on themselves, such as rebuilding the world in theory and fulfilling themselves in sports and the arts.'

'You never have wars among the provinces of your world?'

'Never. The sports competitions are sufficiently developed to eliminate the war instinct. Besides, psychologically, the fact that young people are able to risk their lives in games where systematically there are many deaths during each event suppresses the war instinct.

This enables those who feel this instinct too intensely to satiate it at the peril of their own life, without involving those who do not want to travel along such perilous paths. If on Earth sports and games were more dangerous but organized, it would greatly reduce the chances of creating international conflicts.'

'Are the seven provinces of your world similar?'

'No, as on Earth there are different races and cultures. Our provinces were created and based on those races and cultures, while respecting the freedom and independence of each one.'

'Would it be possible for a man from Earth to visit your planet?'

'Yes, but you would have to wear a space suit adapted for your breathing. You could live without such a suit in a special residence where we have reproduced the Earth's atmosphere. There, many people from Earth live, including Moses, Elijah and Jesus Christ along with many other living testimonies of our creation. We will be able to bring all these people back to Earth when the time comes to support your statements.'

'Why not bring them back at once?'

'Because in your incredulous world, if Jesus Christ returned, he would be placed in a psychiatric institution. Imagine someone landing among you saying he is the Christ. He would certainly be mocked and quickly locked up. If we intervened by performing scientific wonders to show he really was the Christ, that would bring back religions based on God. It would also lend support to the idea of the supernatural or the mystical, and we do not want either.'

Having said that, the small man saluted me for the last time and told me that he would return only when all that he had asked of me was accomplished. Then he climbed back aboard his machine, and it took off and disappeared just as it had on other mornings.


## The Raelian Movement

What a story! What a revelation!

After returning home and classifying and copying up the notes I had taken, I realized the immensity of the task that had been entrusted to me.

I felt I had little chance of carrying it out. But since it is not necessary to hope in order to embark on an undertaking, I decided to do exactly what was asked of me, even though I might be taken for a visionary. After all, if being a visionary means having received the light, then I am quite willing to be considered a visionary. It is better to be called a visionary and know the truth, than to be called enlightened and not know the truth.

I wish to emphasize to skeptics of all kinds that I never drink alcohol and sleep very well at night. One can neither dream for six consecutive days, nor invent all this.

To you who refuse to believe me, I say: Watch the sky, and you will see more and more sights that neither our scientists nor the military will be able to explain - except by foolish babblings aimed at saving reputations which they believe they would lose if the truth did not originate from someone in their closed circle. How could a scientist possibly not know?

Those who condemned Copernicus - because he dared to say the Earth was not the center of the universe - could never admit that someone other than themselves could reveal all that.

But all of you who have seen or will see unidentified flying objects, which some people will explain away as dreams, or weather balloons, or even hallucinations, and all of you who dare not talk about it for fear of being mocked, it is only by getting together with those who believe that you will be able to speak freely.

All these revelations brought me such a sense of well-being and such an inner peacefulness in this world where we do not know what to believe, where we cannot believe in a white bearded God or in a hoofed devil, and where official scientists cannot give precise explanations of our origins and our goals.

In the light of these amazing revelations, everything becomes so clear and seems so simple. Knowing that somewhere in the universe, there is a planet full of people who created us similar to themselves, who love us, all the while fearing that their creations might surpass them — is this not profoundly moving? Especially if one thinks that we will, in turn, be able to participate in the evolution of this Humanity, of which we are a part, like them, by creating life on other worlds.

Now that you have read this book that I have written, in which I have tried to set out as clearly as possible all that was said to me, if you simply think that I have a great imagination and that these writings were produced just to amuse you, then I will be profoundly disappointed.

But perhaps, on the other hand, these revelations will give you confidence in the future and allow you to understand the mystery of creation and the destiny of humanity. Perhaps they will answer the many questions that you have asked yourselves at night ever since your childhood, wondering why we exist and what our purpose is on this Earth. If this happens, I shall be very happy indeed.

Finally, if you understand that all I have said here is the profound truth and wish, as I do, to see these people land here officially very soon to give us their heritage, and if you want to play a part in realizing all that was asked of me, then I will have fulfilled my mission in writing this book.

If this is the case, write to me, and we will welcome you into the Raelian Movement. We will build the residence that they desire, and when we are numerous enough all over the world to wait for them with the respect and love that those who created us would have the right to demand, then they will come, and we will become the beneficiaries of their immense knowledge.

To all of you who believe in God or in Jesus Christ, I say you were right in such a belief. Even if you thought all was not exactly as the Church would have you believe, there was a foundation of truth. You were right to believe in the basis of the scriptures, but wrong to sustain the Church. If you continue to distribute your money to provide cardinals with the finest vestments, and at your expense continue to authorize the existence of the military and their nuclear threat, then it means that you wish to remain primitive and are not interested in entering the golden age to which we are now entitled.

If, however, you wish to participate passively or actively, according to your means, in the creation and development of the Raelian Movement, take your pen and write to me. We will very soon be numerous enough to choose a piece of land on which the embassy will be built. If you still have doubts, read the papers and look at the sky. You will see that sightings of mysterious crafts are becoming more and more numerous, and this will give you the courage to send your letter to me, addressed to:

Rael,
